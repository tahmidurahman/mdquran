Markdown Quran

This is a copy of the Quran with translations from Abdul Haleem and Mufti Taqi. It was put together with a lot of help from Quran.com and Find and Replace on Obsidian. Some of the surahs have additional translations. This is all just because some of these are converted and edited Word documents that I'd started before shifting to markdown.

It's been designed so that each surah has subheadings for the ayaat, and the subheadings are all tags as well so linking to them is fairly versatile. Note that if you want to break it into ayah by ayah pages, you can just use Obsidian's Note Refactor Community Plugin and split by heading 1.
