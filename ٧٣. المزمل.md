**Surah al-Muzzammil | Revelation, Tahajjud and Prayer**
April 25th 2022 | Ustadh Farhan and Ustadh Shabbir

The Makki surahs tend to be more focused towards the wider people, and more on matters of theology and belief (eg. Jannah, Jahannam, Judgement, Tawhid etc.), whereas the Madani surahs are more targeted towards Muslims and they contain more rulings with the formalisation of shari'ah. However, you do have aspects of these latter aspects in the Makki surahs, which some have said to act as proof of the miracle, preceding what is then to come. They also give us an indication of what is expected of the people in early Islam.

The most popular view about the first ayaat is that of Surah Alaq, with Jibreel asking the Prophet to read after squeezing with the Prophet saying that he can't ﷺ. The Prophet is a human being, but if a man could reach some semblance of perfection, then that is the Prophet ﷺ. But at the end of the day, he was made of earth and soil; he ate, slept, breathed and so forth ﷺ. This ethereal experience of revelation then is a fearful thing, physically and emotionally. There is then a pain related to receiving revelation and the first encounter is terrifying, and so he runs to his wife, Khadijah, straight afterwards. Much like the marriage of Musa and Zaapura, this marriage was an extremely close one and he turns to her in his fear ﷺ. And this is an indication of how to respond. Turn to find safety and appreciate somebody who can listen. Khadijah r.a. listens, to support him. She tells him he's someone who helps, questioning why God would look to harm the Prophet ﷺ, and finds her cousin, Waraqah bin Nawfl to support him. Waraqah listens attentively and responds by saying this is the same Naamus (a visitor in a positive sense), that came to Musa and Isa before you. He says he'd love to support him when the people come to drive you out of town, and the Prophet is made to confront that expectation ﷺ. Prior to this, the Prophet ﷺ had been chosen as an arbitrator on the Black Stone, had been called the Sadiq al-Ameen, and very much been loved across Makkah and the Quraysh.

After the first revelation, there was a gap before the next revelation and this really bothered him because it had been confirmed that he had a great task before him without having that experience return. Remember the gravity of revelation, and what that experience must have been like, much akin to Aadam hearing God and Musa heading towards the burning bush to light his way. The Hadith mention that the Prophet walked to the edge of a cliff almost at the point of jumping off, questioning why he had not been given more. It's at that point, as the Prophet ﷺ is sleeping, that he hears the following verses.

Stay up throughout the night, all but a small part of it,
— Abdul Haleem

Keep vigil the night long, save a little -

# #المزمل٧٣-٣

نِّصْفَهُۥٓ أَوِ ٱنقُصْ مِنْهُ قَلِيلًا ٣


˹pray˺ half the night, or a little less,

أَوْ زِدْ عَلَيْهِ وَرَتِّلِ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ تَرْتِيلًا ٤


or a little more—and recite the Quran ˹properly˺ in a measured way.
— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran

Or add to it, and recite the Qur’ān with measured recitation.
— Saheeh International

or make it a little more; and recite the Qur’ān clearly with tartīl (in a distinct and measured tone).
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

or a little more; recite the Quran slowly and distinctly:
— Abdul Haleem

Or add (a little) thereto - and chant the Qur'an in measure,
— English Translation (Pickthall)

Tarteel is said to mean reciting each letter with its due right, in a non-rushed manner. There are three speeds: haddar (fast), tawassut (little slower), and tuul (slow). Rushed where you can hardly hear the letters is not one of these. These a Hadith about the person who does not sing the Qur'an (recite in a rhythm) is not from us. The Qur'an should be recited in a beautiful manner with its peaks, troughs and tajweed.

إِنَّا سَنُلْقِى عَلَيْكَ قَوْلًۭا ثَقِيلًا ٥


˹For˺ We will soon send upon you a weighty revelation.
— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran

We are going to send down to you a weighty discourse.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

We shall send a momentous message down to you.
— Abdul Haleem

For we shall charge thee with a word of weight.
— English Translation (Pickthall)

Nulqi here means to throw. The Prophet ﷺ was asked how the revelations came to him and it was said to be like the ringing of a bell, or a clanking of chains. The reality is that we'll never know. It was like a heavy burden. There was a moment where Zaid ibn Harithah mentions the weight of the Prophet's thigh having almost crushed Zaid when they were sitting closely beside each other at a point of revelation ﷺ. In another Hadith, it's said if the Qur'an were revealed on a mountain, it would have come crushing down.

Give the people who disbelieve some space. The shackles that follow indicate how their handling will happen. These ayaat are generally intended to the disbelievers, but they are also some respite to the Prophet ﷺ, who is not made to take them on as his burden entirely.

Surely your Lord knows that you ˹O Prophet˺ stand ˹in prayer˺ for nearly two-thirds of the night, or ˹sometimes˺ half of it, or a third, as do some of those with you. Allah ˹alone˺ keeps a ˹precise˺ measure of the day and night. He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has turned to you in mercy. So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling throughout the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform ˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to Allah a good loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah far better and more rewarding. And seek Allah’s forgiveness. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran

Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Muḥammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. And Allāh determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the Qur’ān. He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking [something] of the bounty of Allāh and others fighting for the cause of Allāh. So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakāh and loan Allāh a goodly loan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allāh. It is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.
— Saheeh International

Your Lord knows that you stand (in prayer) for nearly two thirds of the night, and (at times) for half of it, and (at times) for one third of it, and (so do) a group of those who are with you. And Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you (O Muslims,) cannot do it in regular way; therefore He turned to you in mercy.Now, recite as much of the Qur’ān as is easy (for you). He knows that some of you may be sick, and others traveling in the land, seeking the grace of Allah, and yet others fighting in Allah’s way. Therefore, recite as much of it as is easy. And establish Salāh, and pay Zakāh, and advance to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you will send ahead for your own-selves, you will find it with Allah much better in condition, and much greater in reward. And seek forgiveness from Allah. Indeed Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

[Prophet], your Lord is well aware that you sometimes spend nearly two-thirds of the night at prayer––sometimes half, sometimes a third––as do some of your followers. God determines the division of night and day. He knows that you will not be able to keep a measure of it and He has relented towards all of you, so recite as much of the Quran as is easy for you. He knows that some of you will be sick, some of you travelling through the land seeking God’s bounty, some of you fighting in God’s way: recite as much as is easy for you, keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and make God a good loan. Whatever good you store up for yourselves will be improved and increased for you. Ask God for His forgiveness, He is most forgiving, most merciful.
— Abdul Haleem

Lo! thy Lord knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly two-thirds of the night, or (sometimes) half or a third thereof, as do a party of those with thee. Allah measureth the night and the day. He knoweth that ye count it not, and turneth unto you in mercy. Recite, then, of the Qur'an that which is easy for you. He knoweth that there are sick folk among you, while others travel in the land in search of Allah's bounty, and others (still) are fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite of it that which is easy (for you), and establish worship and pay the poor-due, and (so) lend unto Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever good ye send before you for your souls, ye will find it with Allah, better and greater in the recompense. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
— English Translation (Pickthall)

Many Hadith at this point raise the early prayers of the Muslims. It was obligatory for them to pray Tahajjud for at least 12 months after these ayaat. They were expected to pray either for the whole night or a large portion of the night. It only stopped once this last ayah was revealed. This ayah abrogated the expectation that they should pray all night long. 

The Sahabah at one point went to Abdullah ibn Abbas asking about witr. He told them to go to A'isha to find out more. Different sahabah had different aspects of knowledge about the Prophet ﷺ and his revelations. Usually on salah, you'd go to those who prayed with the Prophet ﷺ at the front of the rows. None of the senior Sahabah who stood at the front ever did the raising of the hands for instance. It was only the Sahabah at the back that would do this, but none of the seniors narrated it. This comes under the field of Umum Balwah (matters that are common). When it comes to sunnan, the Prophet ﷺ prayed them at home. All the Hadith about the sunnah salah came from the Prophet's wives then. You then go to the Prophet's wives for the most intimate parts of his lives, including tahajjud and witr. The example of Abdullah ibn Abbas pointing the sahabah towards A'isha is our example of this. A Hadith of A'isha says that the Prophet ﷺ never prayed more than 8 rakat tahajjud. Taraweeh goes up to 20. Ibn Kathir mentions taraweeh in this surah. In tahajjud, he prayed all 8 in one go before then praying his witr. There's also the discussion about praying after witr. The best position is to make witr the final prayer. But, you can still pray after it. There's also a long discussion about how to pray witr. The sahabah, after asking their questions to A'isha, came back to Abdullah ibn Abbas, who said he would have listened to her every word right up to the moment she stops.

The Prophet ﷺ had a yearning towards tawhid and didn't pray to the idols. Neither did 'Ali r.a. nor Abu Bakr r.a. There were moments where the Prophet ﷺ was close to something happening, such as his award being revealed or him having come towards music at a party, but he was always protected from it.
