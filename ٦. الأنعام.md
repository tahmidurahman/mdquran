Avoid those who have taken their faith as fun and games. The worldly life has deceived them. Preach with it (the Qur’ān), lest one should be seized for what he did, in a way that he should have neither a helper besides Allah, nor an intercessor.

For them there is a drink of boiling water, and a painful punishment, because they used to disbelieve.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Leave to themselves those who take their religion for a mere game and distraction and are deceived by the life of this world, but continue to remind them with the [Quran], lest any soul be damned by what it has done- it will have no one to protect it from God and no one to intercede; whatever ransom it may offer will not be accepted. Such are those who are damned by their own actions: they will have boil-ing water to drink and a painful punishment, because they used to defy [God].

Say, “Should we invoke, besides Allah, something that can neither benefit us nor harm us? Should we turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us?

Say, ‘Instead of God, are we to call on what neither profits nor harms us? [Are we to] turn on our heels after God has guided us, like someone bewildered, having been tempted by devils into a desert ravine, though his companions call him to guidance [saying], “Come to us”?’ Say, ‘God’s guidance is the true guidance. We are commanded to devote ourselves to the Lord of the Worlds,

They did not hold Allah in due esteem when they said, “Allah has not sent down anything to a human being.” Say, “Who has sent down the Book brought by Mūsā as a light and a guidance for people, which you keep in various sheets (some of which) you disclose, and a lot of which you conceal, and (by which) you were taught what you did not know, neither you nor your fathers?” Say, “Allah.” Then leave them to play with whatever they indulge in.

You were taught things that neither you nor your forefathers had known.’ Say, ‘God [sent it down],’ then leave them engrossed in their vain talk.

Who is more unjust than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah or says, “Revelation has been sent to me”, whereas no revelation has been sent to him, and the one who says, “I would produce the like of what Allah has revealed.” If only you could witness when the unjust are in the throes of death, and the angels stretch their hands (and say), “Out with your souls. Today, you shall have your punishment, a punishment of humiliation, because you have been saying about Allah what is not true, and have been showing arrogance against His verses.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Who could be more wicked than someone who invents a lie against God, or claims, ‘A revelation has come to me,’ when no revelation has been sent to him, or says, ‘I too can reveal something equal to God’s revelation’?

This is how We bring the verses in diverse ways, so that they say, “you have been tutored”, and so that We may explain it to people who have knowledge.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


This is how We explain Our revelations in various ways- though they will say, ‘You [Muhammad] have been studying’- to make them clear for those who know.

Do not revile those whom they invoke other than Allah, lest they should revile Allah in transgression without having knowledge.

— Mufti Taqi Usmani


[Believers], do not revile those they call on beside God in case they, in their hostility and ignorance, revile God. To each community We make their own actions seem alluring, but in the end they will return to their Lord and He will inform them of all they did.

— Mufti Taqi Usmani


They swear by God with their most solemn oaths that if a miraculous sign came to them they would believe in it. Say [Prophet], ‘Signs are in the power of God alone.’ What will make you [believers] realize that even if a sign came to them they still would not believe?

So it is that, for every prophet, We have set up enemies,-the devils of mankind and jinn-who seduce one another with alluring rhetoric in order to deceive-Had Allah willed, they would have not done it. So, leave them alone with what they forge-
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


In the same way We assigned to each prophet an enemy, evil humans and evil jinn. They suggest alluring words to one another in order to deceive- if it had been your Lord’s will, [Prophet], they would not have done this: leave them to their inventions-

So, should I seek someone other than Allah as judge, while it is He who has sent down to you the Book in details? Those We have given the Book know that it is revealed from your Lord with the truth. So, never be one of those who are in suspicion.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


[Say], ‘Shall I seek any judge other than God, when it is He who has sent down for you [people] the Scripture, clearly explained?’ Those to whom We gave the Scripture know that this [Quran] is revealed by your Lord [Prophet] with the truth, so do not be one of those who doubt.

If you obey the majority of those on earth, they will make you lose the way of Allah. They follow nothing but whims, and they do nothing but make conjectures.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


If you obeyed most of those on earth, they would lead you away from the path of God. They follow nothing but speculation; they are merely guessing.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الأنعام٦-١١٧

— Mufti Taqi Usmani


So [believers] eat any [animal] over which God’s name has been pronounced, if you believe in His revelations.

What should cause you to avoid eating of that upon which the name of Allah has been invoked, while He has spelled out to you all that He has made unlawful for you, except that to which you are compelled by extreme necessity? Surely, there are many who misguide people on the basis of their desires without having knowledge. Surely, your Lord is the best knower of those who cross the limits.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Why should you not eat such animals when God has already fully explained what He has forbidden you, except when forced by hunger? But many lead others astray by their desires, without any true knowledge: your Lord knows best who oversteps the limit.
— Abdul Haleem

وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا۟ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُۥ لَفِسْقٌۭ ۗ وَإِنَّ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰٓ أَوْلِيَآئِهِمْ لِيُجَـٰدِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ ١٢١

Do not eat that (meat) over which the name of Allah has not been pronounced. This is surely a sin. The satans inspire their friends to dispute with you. If you were to obey them, you would be Mushriks.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and do not eat anything over which God’s name has not been pronounced, for that is breaking the law. The evil ones incite their followers to argue with you: if you listen to them, you too will become idolaters.

Is it (conceivable) that the one who was dead and to whom We gave life, and set for him a light with which he walks among men, (is held to) be like the one whose condition is such that he is in total darkness, never coming out of it? This is how their deeds appear beautified to the disbelievers.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Is a dead person brought back to life by Us, and given light with which to walk among people, comparable to someone trapped in deep darkness who cannot escape? In this way the evil deeds of the disbelievers are made to seem alluring to them.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الأنعام٦-١٢٣
وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا فِى كُلِّ قَرْيَةٍ أَكَـٰبِرَ مُجْرِمِيهَا لِيَمْكُرُوا۟ فِيهَا ۖ وَمَا يَمْكُرُونَ إِلَّا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ ١٢٣

In a similar way, in every town We caused its chief sinners to commit mischief in it. And they do not commit mischief but against themselves, while they do not realize it.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


And so We have put chief evildoers in every city to perpetrate their schemes there- but they scheme only against themselves, without realizing it.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الأنعام٦-١٢٤
وَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌۭ قَالُوا۟ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ حَتَّىٰ نُؤْتَىٰ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ رُسُلُ ٱللَّهِ ۘ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُۥ ۗ سَيُصِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُوا۟ صَغَارٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعَذَابٌۭ شَدِيدٌۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَمْكُرُونَ ١٢٤

When a sign comes to them, they say, “We shall never come to believe unless we are given the like of what was given to the messengers of Allah.” Allah knows best where to place His message. Those who committed sin shall soon suffer from disgrace before Allah and face severe punishment for the mischief they have been making.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


When a revelation is brought before them they say, ‘We shall not believe unless we ourselves are given a revelation as God’s messengers were.’ But God knows best where to place His messages: humiliation before God and severe torment will befall the evildoers for their scheming.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الأنعام٦-١٢٥
فَمَن يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ أَن يَهْدِيَهُۥ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُۥ لِلْإِسْلَـٰمِ ۖ وَمَن يُرِدْ أَن يُضِلَّهُۥ يَجْعَلْ صَدْرَهُۥ ضَيِّقًا حَرَجًۭا كَأَنَّمَا يَصَّعَّدُ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يَجْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّجْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ ١٢٥

So, whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He makes his heart wide open for Islam, and whomsoever He wills to let go astray, He makes his heart strait and constricted, (and he feels embracing Islam as difficult) as if he were climbing to the sky. In this way, Allah lays abomination on those who do not believe.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


When God wishes to guide someone, He opens their breast to islam; when He wishes to lead them astray, He closes and constricts their breast as if they were climbing up to the skies. That is how God makes the foulness of those who do not believe rebound against them.
— Abdul Haleem

This is the path of your Lord, a straight path. We have made the verses elaborate for people who accept the advice.

The day He will assemble all of them together, (Allah will say to Jinn) “O species of Jinns, you have done too much against mankind.” Their friends from among the human beings will say, “Our Lord, some of us have benefited from others, and we have reached our term that You had appointed for us.” He will say, “The Fire is your Abode wherein you will remain for ever, unless Allah wills (otherwise). Surely, your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


On the day He gathers everyone together [saying], ‘Company of jinn! You have seduced a great many humans,’ their adherents among mankind will say, ‘Lord, we have profited from one another, but now we have reached the appointed time You decreed for us.’ He will say, ‘Your home is the Fire, and there you shall remain’- unless God wills otherwise: [Prophet], your Lord is all wise, all knowing.

“O species of Jinn and mankind, had the messengers not come to you, from among yourselves, who used to relate My verses to you, and used to warn you of the encounter of this your day?” They will say, “We testify against ourselves.” The worldly life had deceived them, and they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


‘Company of jinn and mankind! Did messengers not come from among you to recite My revelations to you and warn that you would meet this Day?’ They will say, ‘We testify against ourselves.’ The life of this world seduced them, but they will testify against themselves that they rejected the truth:

[Prophet], say, ‘My people, you carry on as you are, and so will I: you will come to realize who will have a happy homecoming in the Hereafter.’ The evildoers will not prosper.

وَجَعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ ٱلْحَرْثِ وَٱلْأَنْعَـٰمِ نَصِيبًۭا فَقَالُوا۟ هَـٰذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـٰذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا ۖ فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلَا يَصِلُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَىٰ شُرَكَآئِهِمْ ۗ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ ١٣٦

They have assigned a portion for Allah from the tillage and the cattle created by Him, and then said, “This is for Allah”, so they claim, “And this is for our associate-gods.” Then, that which is allocated for their associate-gods never reaches Allah, while that which is allocated for Allah does reach their associate-gods. Evil is what they judge.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


They apportion to God a share of the produce and the livestock He created, saying, ‘This is for God’- so they claim!- ‘ and this is for our idols.’ Their idols’ share does not reach God, but God’s share does reach their idols: how badly they judge!
— Abdul Haleem



# #الأنعام٦-١٣٧
وَكَذَٰلِكَ زَيَّنَ لِكَثِيرٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ قَتْلَ أَوْلَـٰدِهِمْ شُرَكَآؤُهُمْ لِيُرْدُوهُمْ وَلِيَلْبِسُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ دِينَهُمْ ۖ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا فَعَلُوهُ ۖ فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ ١٣٧

Similarly, their associate-gods have made the killing of their children seem fair to many mushriks (idolators), so that they may ruin them and may confuse their faith for them. Had Allah so willed, they would not have done that. So, leave them alone with what they fabricate.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


In the same way, their idols have induced many of the pagans to kill their own children, bringing them ruin and confusion in their faith: if God had willed otherwise they would not have done this, so [Prophet] leave them to their own devices.
— Abdul Haleem

They say, “These are prohibited cattle and produce; none can eat them except those whom we wish” - so they claimed - “and there are cattle whose backs are prohibited (for riding or loading)”, and there are cattle over which they do not pronounce the name of Allah,-all being fabrications against Him. He will soon punish them for what they have been fabricating.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


They also say, ‘These cattle and crops are reserved, and only those we allow may eat them’- so they claim! There are some animals they exempt from labour and some over which they do not pronounce God’s name [during slaughter], falsely attributing these [regulations] to Him: He will repay them for the falsehoods they invent.
— Abdul Haleem

They say, “Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is purely for our males, and forbidden to our wives.” If it be born dead, then all of them share in it. Soon, He will punish them for what they attribute. Surely, He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


They also say, ‘The contents of these animals’ wombs will be reserved solely for our men and forbidden to our women, though if the offspring is stillborn they may have a share of it.’ He will punish them for what they attribute to Him: He is all wise, all aware.

Losers are those who kill their children foolishly, without knowledge, and hold as prohibited what Allah has provided them, falsely ascribing it to Allah. They have gone astray, and they are not on the right path.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Lost indeed are those who kill their own children out of folly, with no basis in knowledge, forbidding what God has provided for them, fabricating lies against Him: they have gone far astray and have heeded no guidance.

He is the One who has created gardens, trellised and untrellised, and date-palms and crops with a variety of edibles, and the olive and the pomegranate, (some) similar to one another, and (some) dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it bears fruits, and pay its due on the day of harvest, and do not be extravagant. Surely, Allah does not like the extravagant
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


It is He who produces both trellised and untrellised gardens, date palms, crops of diverse flavours, the olive, the pomegranate, alike yet different. So when they bear fruit, eat some of it, paying what is due on the day of harvest, but do not be wasteful: God does not like wasteful people.

(Allah has created) eight pairs: two of sheep and two of goats. Say, “Is it the two males that He has prohibited or the two females, or whatever the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me on the basis of knowledge if you are true.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


[God gave you] eight animals, in [four] pairs: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats- ask them [Prophet], ‘Has He forbidden the two males, the two females, or the young in the wombs of the two females? Tell me based on knowledge if you are telling the truth.’

And (He has created) two of camels and two of oxen. Say, “Is it the two males that He has prohibited or the two females or whatever the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you present when Allah has advised you of this?” So, who is more unjust than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah in order to misguide people without knowledge? Surely, Allah gives no guidance to an unjust people.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


And a pair of camels and a pair of cattle- ask them [Prophet], ‘Has He forbidden the two males, the two females, or the young in the wombs of the two females? Were you present when God gave you these commands?’ So who is more wicked than he who fabricates lies against God with no basis in knowledge in order to lead people astray? God does not guide the evildoers.

Say, “I do not find, in what has been revealed to me, anything (out of the cattle under discussion) prohibited for anyone who eats it, unless it be carrion or blood that pours forth, or flesh of swine - because it is impure - or there be an animal slaughtered sinfully by invoking on it the name of someone other than Allah. However, if anyone is compelled by necessity, neither seeking pleasure nor crossing the limit, then your Lord is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


[Prophet], say, ‘In all that has been revealed to me, I find nothing forbidden for people to eat, except for carrion, flowing blood, pig’s meat- it is loathsome- or a sinful offering over which any name other than God’s has been invoked.’ But if someone is forced by hunger, rather than desire or excess, then God is most forgiving and most merciful.

For those who are Jews We prohibited all that has claws. Of cows and goats, We prohibited for them their fats, except that which is borne by their backs or the entrails, or what is attached to a bone. Thus We recompensed them for their transgression. We are definitely truthful.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


We forbade for the Jews every animal with claws, and the fat of cattle and sheep, except what is on their backs and in their intestines, or that which sticks to their bones. This is how We penalized them for their disobedience: We are true to Our word.

Those who associate partners with Allah will say, “Had Allah willed, we would have not associated (partners with Him), nor our fathers, nor would we have made anything prohibited.” In the same way those who went before them gave the lie to (the truth) until they tasted Our punishment. Say, “Do you have any sure knowledge that you may produce to us? You follow nothing but whims, and do nothing but make conjectures.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


The idolaters will say, ‘If God had willed, we would not have ascribed partners to Him- nor would our fathers- or have declared anything forbidden.’ In the same way, those before them continually denied [the truth] until they tasted Our punishment.

Say, “Bring your witnesses who testify that Allah has prohibited this.” Then, if they testify, (O prophet), do not be a witness to them, and do not follow the desires of those who have given the lie to Our signs and those who do not believe in the Hereafter, and who equate others with their Lord.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani
