And Yūsuf had already come to you earlier with clear signs, but you remained in suspicion about what he brought to you - until when he died, you said, ‘Allah will never send a messenger after him.’ That is how Allah lets go astray anyone who crosses limits and lives in doubt, -

أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـٰقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ ۚ كَانُوٓا۟ أَكْثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةًۭ وَءَاثَارًۭا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَمَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ ٨٢

Have they not traveled through the earth and seen how was the fate of those before them? Most of them were more in numbers than these, and superior in vigor and vestiges left on the earth. So then, whatever they used to earn did not work for them at all.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Have they not travelled through the land and seen how those who lived before them met their end? They were more numerous than them, stronger than them, and made a more impressive mark on the land, yet what they achieved was of no use to them at all.
— Abdul Haleem

فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ فَرِحُوا۟ بِمَا عِندَهُم مِّنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ ٨٣

When their messengers came to them with manifest signs, they exulted because of whatever knowledge they had, and they were encircled by what they used to ridicule.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


When messengers came to them with clear signs, they revelled in the knowledge they had, and so they were engulfed by the very punishment they mocked:
— Abdul Haleem



# #غافر٤٠-٨٤
فَلَمَّا رَأَوْا۟ بَأْسَنَا قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَحْدَهُۥ وَكَفَرْنَا بِمَا كُنَّا بِهِۦ مُشْرِكِينَ ٨٤

When they saw Our punishment, they said, “We have (now) come to believe in Allah alone, and We have rejected everything we used to ascribe (to Him) as partners.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


when they saw Our punishment, they said, ‘We believe in God alone; we reject any partner we ascribed to Him,’
— Abdul Haleem



# #غافر٤٠-٨٥
فَلَمْ يَكُ يَنفَعُهُمْ إِيمَـٰنُهُمْ لَمَّا رَأَوْا۟ بَأْسَنَا ۖ سُنَّتَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِۦ ۖ وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ ٱلْكَـٰفِرُونَ ٨٥

But, their profession of faith was not (competent) to benefit them, once they had seen Our punishment - a customary practice of Allah that has been there all along in the matter of His servants - and hence, the disbelievers became the losers.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


but believing after seeing Our punishment did not benefit them at all- this has always been God’s way of dealing with His creatures- there and then the disbelievers were lost.
— Abdul Haleem
