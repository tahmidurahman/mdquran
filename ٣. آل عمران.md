He is the One who has revealed to you the Book (the Qur’ān). Out of it there are verses that are MuHkamāt (of established meaning), which are the principal verses of the Book, and some others are Mutashābihāt (whose definite meanings are unknown). Now those who have perversity in their hearts go after such part of it as is mutashābih, seeking (to create) discord, and searching for its interpretation (that meets their desires), while no one knows its interpretation except Allah; and those well-grounded in knowledge say: “We believe therein; all is from our Lord.” Only the men of understanding observe the advice.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


it is He who has sent this Scripture down to you [Prophet]. Some of its verses are definite in meaning- these are the cornerstone of the Scripture- and others are ambiguous. The perverse at heart eagerly pursue the ambiguities in their attempt to make trouble and to pin down a specific meaning of their own: only God knows the true meaning. Those firmly grounded in knowledge say, ‘We believe in it: it is all from our Lord’- only those with real perception will take heed-

“There was a sign for you in the two groups who confronted each other: One group fighting in the way of Allah, and the other disbelieving, seeing themselves as twice their number, with open eyes. And Allah gives strength with His help to whomsoever He wills. Indeed, there is a lesson therein for those who have eyes.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


You have already seen a sign in the two armies that met in battle, one fighting for God’s cause and the other made up of disbelievers. With their own eyes [the former] saw [the latter] to be twice their number, but God helps whoever He will. There truly is a lesson in this for all with eyes to see.’

Truly, the (recognized) religion in the sight of Allah is Islām . Those who have been given the Book did not differ (among themselves) until after the knowledge had come to them, (and all this) due to envy against each other. Whoever denies the verses of Allah, then, Allah is swift at reckoning.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

Then, if they argue with you, say: “I have submitted myself to Allah, and (so did) those who have followed me.” And say to those who have been given the Book, and to the unlettered: “Do you submit?” If they submit, they will be on the right path. Yet, if they turn back, then you have only to convey the message. Allah is watchful over (all of) His servants.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


if they argue with you [Prophet], say, ‘I have devoted myself to God alone and so have my followers.’ Ask those who were given the Scripture, as well as those without one, ‘Do you too devote yourselves to Him alone?’ If they do, they will be guided, but if they turn away, your only duty is to convey the message.

That is because they have said: “The Fire shall not touch us except for a few days.” Thus they are deceived in their faith by what they themselves used to invent.

<p align="right"> اِنَّ اَوَّلَ بَيۡتٍ وُّضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَـلَّذِىۡ بِبَكَّةَ مُبٰرَكًا وَّهُدًى لِّلۡعٰلَمِيۡنَ​​ۚ‏ ٩٦</p>

Mufti Taqi: The first house set up for the people is surely the one in Makkah having blessings and guidance for all the worlds.

Saheeh International: Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah [i.e., Makkah] - blessed and a guidance for the worlds.

Translation: The first house set up for the people is surely the one in Makkah and it is a guidance for mankind

What is Bakkah here? There are a lot of opinions. Commonly though of as an ancient name for Makkah. The mufassireen generally use Bakkah and Makkah synonymously. Ibn Kathir provides a list of other names for the area. Two reasons for the use of Bakkah stated:

1.     Addressing the bani Isra'il so it's to reference the ancient name. It's referenced in the Psalms as Bakkah. Allah (s.w.t.) uses the name they would recognise. Imam Tabari refutes the notion that there are foreign words in the Qur'an, although Suyuti says the opposite. Tabari says neighbouring regions tend to share words but you can't claim that any region lays claim to it. 

2.     It goes with the saj'a of the ayah (it flows)

Bakkah's root letters give you 'to cry', 'to bemoan', 'to weep'. The verb has the connotations of lamenting and grieving behind those tears. It's mentioned in Ibn Kathir that the Ka'bah is a place at which tears are wept. It's considered mustahabb to gaze at the Ka'bah. As a side note, let the magnificence of Islam and its crowd be known; experience it and have the youngers witness it too.

Tan'im, and specifically Masjid Ayesha, is the Miqat of the people of Makkah (where you do Ihram from for Umrah). There used to be a valley that would go all the way down to Tan'im. From the Ka'bah to the edge of the valley is Bakkah. From the end of the valley / ring around the Ka'bah all through to Tan'im is Makkah. Bakkah is a more specific smaller area than Makkah. The whole inner ring would have encompassed what would have been Makkah before. Also, Medinah would most likely have been encompassed within the space we now consider Masjid Nabawi. Also argued that the south region down to Batha Quraysh is Bakkah (Abdullah ibn Abbas) whereas the north region from the Ka'bah to Tan'im is Makkah.

Psalm 84: 5-7 mentions Bakkah. 'How lovely your dwellings O Lord of armies...' There's a praising and a desire to visit the courts of the Lord. 'Even the bird has found a home and the swallow a nest for itself that puts its fledglings by your alters. The place where we worship you ... Happy are those who dwell in your house'. Verse 6 is very reminiscent of sirat al-mustaqim. Then in verse 7, Bakkah is mentioned although in the commentary they make it into a spring, and there's mention of it as a valley for pilgrimage. 'As they come through the valley of Baca on their way to Mount Zion...' - there's no mention of Makkah but rather it's a place on the way to Jerusalem. This Baca is also connected to a place called Moreh, both of which are located on the path to Jerusalem.

Ibn Kathir notes that the Makkah is such a sanctuary that you can't hunt game, harm a bird's nest or pluck leaves from the trees or bushes. It's a sanctuary for humans, animals and its nature. 'On the conquest of Makkah, Allah established its position as a sanctuary until the day of reckoning. And it has never been permissible for anyone to fight in Makkah before the Prophet ﷺ, nor was it acceptable for him other than in that one hour in which the Prophet ﷺ marched in and conquered Makkah. And from that point onwards, it would be forever forbidden to fight until Qiyamah. Therefore, its plants, shrubs and trees may not be uprooted, nor can its animals be hunted, and even its lost property cannot be picked up except if you know to whom it belongs.' The maktabah under the ajyad bridge when you keep going towards it, opposite its wudu facilities, there is a lost and found place there where it can be given now. 'It's fields cannot be emptied except idhkhir (camelgrass) for indeed it is used for qain (generally blacksmiths but also translated as for graves) and housing (adobe - the mixture of wet earth and grass made into bricks and dried in the sun). Ibn Kathir adds that we have another narration that troops were sent to Makkah (thawrah [rebellion] of Abdullah ibn Zubayr). Amr ibn Sa'id was potentially the commander. He said in that act 'Give me permission to speak and I'll tell you that I remember when the Prophet ﷺ was speaking, glorifying Allah, and said that Allah had made Makkah a sanctuary, that nobody could harm it, and that nobody would shed blood in it or pluck out its trees. If anybody was to look at the conquest of the Prophet ﷺ and were to use it as evidence for themselves, the Prophet said it was permitted for me but not for you. And indeed it was only permitted to the Prophet just for a period. Those who were present shall tell you that this was the case. It was then said to Abu Shurayh al-Adawi, during this rebellion, that 'I know more than you. Indeed the haram is not a sanctuary for a sinner and for somebody who rebels.' People have violated the sanctuary status since the Prophet ﷺ but they have also been held accountable. It's also not acceptable for arms to be carried into Makkah. Another narration says while the prophet was standing in Khazwarah in the market of Makkah, he said 'By Allah, you are the best of lands and it is the most beloved of lands to Allah. And had I not been expelled from you (Makkah), then I would not have left.' That Hadith has been narrated by Imam Ahmed and graded saheeh. On echoing the conquest of Makkah that then comes early in the next ayah, whoever enters the house of Abu Sufyan and then whoever enters or is in the vicinity of Ka'bah is safe. A method of determining who is with the Muslims because they'll be safe but it's also an indication of Makkah as the haram.

## #آل-عمران٣-٩٧
<p align="right">فِيۡهِ اٰيٰتٌ ۢ بَيِّنٰتٌ مَّقَامُ اِبۡرٰهِيۡمَۚ   وَمَنۡ دَخَلَهٗ كَانَ اٰمِنًا ​ؕ وَلِلّٰهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ الۡبَيۡتِ مَنِ اسۡتَطَاعَ اِلَيۡهِ سَبِيۡلًا ​ؕ وَمَنۡ كَفَرَ فَاِنَّ اللّٰهَ غَنِىٌّ عَنِ الۡعٰلَمِيۡنَ‏ ٩٧</p>

Translation: In it are clear signs such as Maqam Ibrahim. And whomsoever enters it shall be safe (echoes the conquest of Makkah). And for the right of Allah and the duty and responsibility on mankind is to do the pilgrimage, those who are able. Those that disbelieve [should know that] God is independent of the worlds [has no need].

When we think about duty and responsibility, it raises a question of where Fiqhi rulings come from. This ayah gives us the legislation and the obligation of Hajj. If the ability is found, then it is obligatory for you to do Hajj, and if not, then it is not. "Whomsoever is able to do so" is the sabab, although some say it's condition (cause [eg. sabab of salah is the time of day; sabab of sawm is the month of Ramadan]). Condition (shark) is something after the sabab has come into effect. Condition ascertains the validity of the action. External to the action but something you have greater control over. Required as a prerequisite. Having enough money is not a prerequisite because without it, Hajj cannot be performed. A condition is something that won't stop it being able to be done. Salah provides an easier example. Until the sun has set, there is no way yo ucan pray. Once it has set, the sabab has been met. Now the condition is wudu. Technically you can pray but it would invalidate it. Sabab precedes these other prerequisites. The conditions for Hajj are niyah and being in the state of ihram. Abstinence from fusuk (killing animals, hunting), jidal (argumentation) and rafa (sexual intercourse) are expectations (except rafa will invalidate). These are not conditions. They could be nullifiers but, for instance, jidal and fusuk might not necessarily nullify. Doing things with khushu is the ideal but that's not always possible. It doesn't nullify but it does effect the reward outcome.

On Maqam Ibrahim, Ibn Kathir notes that it's a physical sign that Ibrahim (a.s) was there. The Maqam is the stone that he stood on when he built the Ka'bah and the marks are still there. This is the physical relic that connects you to the past. Hajar al-Aswad is the oldest remaining aspect of the Ka'bah and thereafter is the Maqam Ibrahim. Ibrahim built the Ka'bah with Isma'il, who provided him with the stones. Isma'il (a.s.) was told to collect a different looking stone to provide the starting point around the Ka'bah. Jibril came to Ibrahim while this was happening and said "I know when Aadam left jannah he was given the opportunity to take one gift from jannah and he took a white stone from paradise. Ibrahim asks for that stone and so Jibril took that stone (some say from Aadam's grave - he was buried with this celestial stone) and gave it to Ibrahim. As time went on, then the stone itself turned black, as some say with the sin of mankind. And Ibrahim then placed that black stone in the Ka'bah. All we have now though are fragments of the Hajr-al-Aswad (black stone) which has been stolen, shattered, broken and damaged through time. You'll find people who claim to have fragments in other countries as well. The Jurhamites, in their conflicts in Makkah took it and hid the well of zamzam. Abd al-Muttalib was given a dream to dig, and he did, and he found zamzam and the black stone. He placed it back in the Ka'bah after a fight among the Quraysh about who gets the right to do so. Abd al-Muttalib claimed it as the closest of the decendants of Isma'il. They made a way for it to be decided who placed it there and the one who pushed it in was the Prophet ﷺ (before the message). People thereafter continued to push it in as well. Hundreds of thousands of people were doing Tawaf at the time (more than ever before). In the time of Umar ibn al-Khattab, he pushed the Maqam Ibrahim back into the position that it's in. The door was on the ground at the time and there was no roof but people have looked after and developed it over time. It's about 7/8 feet from the ground so you have to reach up to grab the bottom. The Maqam Ibrahim used to be on the outside of the Ka'bah and there used to be two doors both on the ground. That was also moved and it's now been protected in a protective case about 20 yards from the Ka'bah. When it was rebuilt in the time of Quraysh, they didn't want to use any haraam money so they couldn't built it in its original form so they built it smaller but marked out the boundary. Nowadays that's liked a marble skirting board that goes around the Ka'bah. People who have rebuilt the Ka'bah have in the past considered which foundations to base the rebuilding on (Ibrahim a.s. or the same as the Prophet ﷺ desired from the Quraysh rebuilding). Scholars came together to say you can't just keep changing it according to rulers' beliefs and prevented the reshaping, and now changes are more about maintenance. We have now the model from the time of Quraysh. 

Ibn Kathir summarises the ayah by saying the first house built for all of mankind (not just Muslims) is the one in Makkah (Ka'bah) which Ibrahim (a.s.) made. There are arguments about who made the Ka'bah. Another Quranic ayah says that Ibrahim (a.s.) raised it after it had already been built after Aadam built it. And there's a hadith that says the angels, a thousand years before the creation of Aadam, were told to make bait al-ma'mur in the seventh heaven, and angels do Tawaf there. Allah ordered the angels to make a house in the image of bait al-ma'mur and that was the Ka'bah. These are the three stances on who made the Ka'bah. Ibn Kathir notes that the Jews and Christians claim Ibrahim (a.s.) but they don't use the Ka'bah (although the Jews used to until shirk was introduced). Apparently it has been alluded to in Christian scriptures but not sure where. The Greeks and the Romans have both spoken about the Ka'bah and many have spoken about it for centuries before Islam. Ibrahim (a.s.) made dua for Allah to bless this land so that people may from its fruit and crop when he left Hajar there, and that dua remains to this day simply when you look at how much water is available in such an arid desert.

As an aside, you don't use miracles as an evidence for anything but we don't deny them either. The stance of Imam Tahawi, which is that we believe in the miracles of Allah, is accepted across the board of madhabs.

Who built al-Aqsa? Suleiman (a.s.) is said but some say this was a rebuilding. Ibn Kathir questions how many years apart Aqsa and the Ka'bah were built. The Messenger ﷺ said it was 40 years apart so it couldn't have been Suleiman (a.s.). You could calculate options using the three options mentioned above for the Ka'bah. It's possible that Aadam built Aqsa after the angels built the Ka'bah. Or that Ibrahim (a.s.) built both. It's mentioned in Ibn Kathir that 'Ali's hadith says the first place of worship of Allah was the Ka'bah and Aqsa was the second.

Ibn Kathir: 'According to the majority of scholars, this ayah establishes the wujub of hajj.' That comes from the "'ala" which implies the makhduf khabr being wujub. You could interpret it as 'waajib 'ala an-nas' rather than simply as it is. Translate it all as 'the right of Allah is the obligation on the people'. Hijj is the delayed mubtada mu'akhkhara while a khabr has come before (even though in the shibh al-jumla that khabr is dropped) and there's the other khabr that is 'li-llahi'. Where 'ala is for wujub (obligation/duties/responsibilites), the laam harf jar is for haqq (rights). Ibn Kathir: 'Others have said a different ayah establishes the obligation' and that's because there's a command in it (Baqarah:196). 'Many Hadith have been narrated telling us that hajj is indeed one of the pillars, central foundations, focal points of Islam. And the Muslims have a legal consensus that indeed Hajj is an obligation. And it is obligatory upon the one who is legally responsible (mukallaf - able to appreciate the address of Allah, to understand and interpret the hukum of Allah, consider sanity, age, health, can do what they are told to do with accountability and an appreciation of their actions as responsible, someone who is taklif [has legal responsibility]).' He then quotes Hadith: 'A man asks: 'do we have to perform hajj every year?' And the Prophet ﷺ stayed quiet until it had been asked three times after which he says, 'Had I said yes, it would have been obligatory on you, but you wouldn't have been able to do so'.' Ulama say that a command in itself is not assumed to be repetitive because of this Hadith. When a command is given, assume just the once. 'By asking too many questions people were destroyed, and by going against the prophets. So when I command you to do something, do it if you're able to.' The chain is given. Another account of the Hadith adds that it's nafl if you choose to do hajj more than once.

On the authority of Jabar, and about Suraaqa ibn Maalik (who was searching for the Prophet and said that he wouldn't report them when he found the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr (r.a). He redirected others who were searching [and was told he'd wear riches that he ended up wearing for a moment]), he asks if we do tama'tu once and it applies forever, and that's confirmed. The Prophet ﷺ said to his wives that they should adhere to the surface of their straw mats (stay home). You will be able to do hajj one year, not go another year and then do it another point as nafl if you like in another year. It's all presented in a mixed up order because it's a chopped up Hadith.

On a practical note for when you go, you enter into two separate ihrams with different intentions. The first ihram is for umrah, then you exit, and then you enter into ihram of hajj, but at the inception you intend both.

Ibn Kathir: 'As for istita'a (ability), there are many types. Either we talk about ability as physical ability to perform hajj or something that will impede for other reasons (eg financial, food without being indebted and to support dependents whilst gone). As has been established in the books of Fiqh, al-Haakim narrates [...] that the Messenger ﷺ was asked [...] what is sabeel (road / pathway)? The Prophet ﷺ said 'having enough provisions and having a ride that will take you there (travel / food / housing)' The Hadith is Saheeh although Bukhara and Muslim haven't narrated it. 'The Prophet ﷺ said: Hasten to hajj for you don't know what will happen to you in the next year'. Imam Quduri mentions a debate amongst two students of Abu Hanifa on whether hajj can be done immediately or if it can be delayed. Some ulama say hajj can be delayed although zakah cannot. The rights of mankind must have their needs met immediately whereas Allah does need your hajj. Some have made the reverse argument.

Ibn Kathir: 'Whoever rejects the obligation of hajj, they have disbelieved and Allah is not in need of him. Abu Bakr al-Ismaili on the authority of [[عمر بن الخطابؓ]] said 'If you can perform hajj and you don't, then you die as though you are a Jew or a Christian.' This is authentically attributed. Another narration of [[عمر بن الخطابؓ]] is 'I wish I could send men to the cities to see who doesn't perform hajj because then I could make them pay jizyah (a tax for non-Muslims).' This could be rhetoric given the mention of 'wish'. We don't know if he means that they actually are not Muslim.

<p align="right"> قُلۡ يٰۤـاَهۡلَ الۡكِتٰبِ لِمَ تَكۡفُرُوۡنَ بِاٰيٰتِ اللّٰهِ ۖ وَاللّٰهُ شَهِيۡدٌ عَلٰى مَا تَعۡمَلُوۡنَ‏ ٩٨</p>

Say O Messenger ﷺ: O Ahlul Kitaab, why do you reject the signs/verses of Allah? And Allah, he is a witness to what you do.

Ayah could mean signs in terms of signs in the wider world but it could also mean verses. It could also mean dreams. The mark at the end of an ayah in the Quran then doesn't mark the end of a sentence but rather, it marks the end of a sign towards truth; they lead you from one place to another. That mark also does come in the middle of sentences. The pattern of shaheed / fa'eel gives you sifatul mushabbahah represent a permanent quality (as opposed to fa'il which is a temporary quality).

## #آل-عمران٣-٩٩
<p align="right">قُلۡ يٰۤـاَهۡلَ الۡكِتٰبِ لِمَ تَصُدُّوۡنَ عَنۡ سَبِيۡلِ اللّٰهِ مَنۡ اٰمَنَ تَبۡغُوۡنَهَا عِوَجًا وَّاَنۡتُمۡ شُهَدَآءُ ​ؕ وَمَا اللّٰهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعۡمَلُوۡنَ‏ ﻿﻿ ٩٩</p>

Say O Messenger ﷺ: O Ahlul Kitaab, why do you impede/block/stop people who believe from treading the path of Allah, seeking to make the truth crooked whilst you bear witness, and Allah is not heedless of what you do.

Look back to ayah 95 and note that this is a call back to Ibrahim (a.s.) as the pillar of monotheism and the one who broke the idols. He's the one who argued with Nimrod, who was dumbfounded in his claim to being a deity. It's Ibrahim (a.s.) that built the Ka'bah and all the Abrahamic faiths lay claim to him. And so Allah (s.w.t.) is saying, if Ibrahim (a.s.) is so important to you and you claim him, then why do you not practice in his tradition. Also, look to ayah 96 where the Ka'bah is a guidance to the world; a single place that represents the oneness of Allah (s.w.t.). Over the passages that have come, there are constant references to the oneness of Allah and the oneness of the religion. This ayah then continues this reprimand of the Jews and Christians who refuse to believe despite this connection. Each of these verses start with qul, and that's also a part of the reminder to do da'wah in these relationships that we have with anyone who avoids this truth.

Ibn Kathir: This is a reprimand/rebuke (ta'neef) from Allah (t.a.) to the disbelievers from the Ahlul Kitaab due to their stubbornness, and due to their rejection of the aayat of Allah, and impeding others from blocking the path of Allah and (among them) the ones who strive for iman and obedience from the Ahlul Kitab, casting doubt on the knowledge of the prophets. And they had knowledge of the Prophets before and they rejected them, and from these prophets they knew that another prophet ﷺ would come and who he would be, and yet they rejected him ﷺ. The prophets of old gave glad tidings of this prophet ﷺ, and they were told that he would be unlettered, an Arab and from Makkah. They knew that he ﷺ would be the seed of all prophets, and that he would be a messenger of the lord of the worlds. And Allah warns them that Allah watches everything / sees what they do, and how they turn against the truth that is already in front of them. Allah is informing them that he is not heedless of what they do, and will recompense them on a day where no wealth, nor children will benefit them.

يٰۤـاَيُّهَا الَّذِيۡنَ اٰمَنُوۡۤا اِنۡ تُطِيۡعُوۡا فَرِيۡقًا مِّنَ الَّذِيۡنَ اُوۡتُوا الۡكِتٰبَ يَرُدُّوۡكُمۡ بَعۡدَ اِيۡمَانِكُمۡ كٰفِرِيۡنَ‏ ١٠٠

Translation: O you who believe, if you were to obey a group of those who were given the Book, then they would endeavour to turn you away from your faith to kufr.

This is a reflection on the belief that their own deviances are the ones that should lead the way. They believe their beliefs as truth, and they look to guide you towards that. A translation includes that those who obey are those that follow sharia and adds that turning you away includes causing doubt in you. 

## #آل-عمران٣-١٠١

وَكَيۡفَ تَكۡفُرُوۡنَ وَاَنۡـتُمۡ تُتۡلٰى عَلَيۡكُمۡ اٰيٰتُ اللّٰهِ وَفِيۡكُمۡ رَسُوۡلُهٗ ​ؕ وَمَنۡ يَّعۡتَصِمۡ بِاللّٰهِ فَقَدۡ هُدِىَ اِلٰى صِرَاطٍ مُّسۡتَقِيۡمٍ‏ ﻿﻿ ١٠١

Translation: And how can you disbelieve whilst it is you unto whom the aayat of Allah are being recited? And whilst the Messenger is conveying these messages to you? And whomsoever is reliant on Allah and whomsoever holds firm, they have been guided to the true path.

Ibn Kathir: Allah is warning his servants about obeying a group from the Ahlul Kitaab. Those who envy the believers for what Allah has given them of virtue, and those things that Allah has given them. [Looking at farīqa min, the min is being use to portion and to indicate that this is not about 'all', although there will always be a group of the Ahlul Kitaab that are more concerned about your faith than their own deviance, wanting to take you from your truth]. "Many of the Ahlul Kitaab wish that they could turn you away after you have believed to disbelief out of the envy that emanates from them" (Baqarah 109) [...]. Kufr is distant from you, and may you be distant from it (wa haashaakum minh). The aayat of Allah are being revealed to the Messenger day and night [... how can you disbelieve]? 

[Hadith] One day, he said to the Sahabah, "Which of the believers astonish you the most in their faith?" They respond with the angels. [Consider the adab of the Sahabah; they don't have too many believers to think about so they go to the angels, believing their purity to be a sign of their excellence]. And they go on to say, how can the angels not believe when they are with their Lord? [Their faith then is not astonishing]. So then they say the prophets and the Prophet responds saying, "How can they not believe when they have wahi?" So then they say 'us' (our generation). And the Prophet responds, "How can you not believe whilst I am amongst you?" So they say, "Which people then are most astonishing O Messenger of Allah?" He replies, "A people that come after you who will find books and scripture and they will believe in it." [It's our belief then that is most astonishing]. Ibn Kathir mentioned the chain of this Hadith in his commentary on Bukhari.

In his commentary related to the ayah from 'wa man', Ibn Kathir then writes a list of all the ways in which the revelations act as guidance to the true path and the fulfilment of what was intended by Allah. This Hadith, importantly, isn't talking about the best of us but rather those that are the most astonishing.

O you who believe, fear Allah as He deserves to be feared, and do not die lest you are Muslims.

Across Ali 'Imran, we start with the family of 'Imran, then we look at the wrongs done by the Ahlul Kitaab, before then looking to the connection with Ibrahim (a.s) and questioning why people follow through with such atrocities. He then explains what the disbelievers do, before now addressing those who believe, and questions how you can disbelieve, and then we arrive at these two aayat, where we're told what we should do rather than what we shouldn't do. We are to fear Allah as he is meant to be feared.

  
Haqq is mansūb, potentially because it's a na'ib maf'ul mutlaq, or haal. If it is a na'ib, it's not a synonymous masdar as you'd expect but it's a different one (maf'ul mutlaq with mudaf ilayh: tuqa). The original format would have been attuqat al-haqq (it's close to idafat ul-sifa where you can flip ascription and adjectival forms around like ring of silver - silver ring). You could then have translated this as deserving fear but the ascription relationship and mansūb makes 'fear Allah in a manner that he deserves to be feared': maf'ul mutlaq for clarification (that provides the aspect of 'in a manner that').

When the sahabah heard this ayah, some of them fainted. They asked the Prophet how they could fear Allah as He deserves; it's a task that's impossible to meet.

Arabic Translation: O you who believe and act according to the sharia, fear Allah as he deserves to be feared. And how can one fear Allah as such, he is to be obeyed as he deserves, showed gratitude, remembered and not forgotten, and continue to hold firmly to Islam until the last moments of your life so when you meet him, you are with him.

Ibn Kathir: [On do not die except whilst you are Muslims]. Protect your Islam and remain upon Islam whilst you are in good health and safe so you die too in Islam. Indeed the Most Noble will reward a person out of his bounties knowing that a man dies upon what they lived upon. [[When tawbah won't be accepted | Tawbah is not accepted on your death bed or when the sun rises from the West]]. And a man is resurrected the way he dies. 

[Hadith in Ibn Kathir:] If a single drop from Zakkūm (a tree that grows in the middle of Jahannam) were to be dropped on Earth, then all the livelihood of the Earth would become bitter. So now contemplate the state of a person who only has Zakkum as his sustenance. [This Hadith is Hasan Sahih and similar Hadiths have been graded Sahih]

[Hadith in Ibn Kathir:] Whomsoever wishes to be saved / moved away (zahzaha - four root letters) from the fire and to enter Paradise, so let him grasp his death [be conscious of it]. And the way one grasps death is to be conscious of it by believing in Allah and the last day. In the end, you receive what you love.

[Hadith in Ibn Kathir:] I [?] heard the Prophet ﷺ say, three days before his death that: 'None of you should die except those with a good opinion of Allah, hoping for his blessings.'

And hold firmly onto the rope of Allah, all of it/you, and do not break off into factions, and remember the blessings of Allah that He has bestowed upon you. Remember that you were enemies. And remember that Allah drew your hearts together and you became brothers and this was a blessing for him. And you were on the brink of a pit of fire and he saved you from it. Likewise does Allah clarify for you his signs; perhaps you will be guided.

Arabic Translation: All of you hold onto the Quran and sunnah. And do not serve the agendas of your factions and groups. And remember the majestic blessings that Allah has bestowed upon you. And remember the enemies from before you were Muslims (Aws, Khazraj, etc.). Allah caused you all to be close with love of Allah and love for his Messenger. And he cast love for each other into your hearts. And you became, by his virtue, brothers with love, whilst you were on the brink of the fires of Hell. And he saved you (from that). And likewise, Allah clarifies, for you, the tenets of Islam and likewise, everything that is there for your correction so that you may be guided to the path of righteousness and so that he may guide you to the straight path so do not deviate from it.

Note: most likely when people mention just Abdullah, they tend to mean Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (particularly if it's a Hanafi text). If it's Maliki or Shafi'i, it could be ibn Umar, and for others it could be ibn Abbas. 'Abaadilah is the term for the sahabah called Abdullah, and there's a list of the most famous five. 

Ibn Kathir: [in the chain we have a marfu' chain from a mawquf chain so we can consider it marfu' bust most consider this mawquf]. Said ibn Jubayr as well as others have taken the opinion that this ayah is abrogated. [We don't need to fear Allah as He deserves because we can't. Allah gives you the ideal standard to show you what it should be, but after letting you realise this, he reduces it. We are to know the actual standard]. Abrogated by: 'Fear Allah as much as you are able to do so.' And Abdullah ibn Abbas says that it's not been abrogated but the rights deserved doesn't mean that you actually meet it but rather that you try to meet what He deserves. And you will not be seized/taken and blamed if you did not reach perfection, as long as you continued to establish justice, even if it be on yourself [where you wronged someone]. [You try your utter best but Allah won't judge you for your shortcomings, but you must uphold justice to that right].

Ibn Kathir: [on holding firmly] It has been said that the rope of Allah is the covenant of Allah that we all are under (eg. worshipping alone, deserving rights, the sharia). Humiliation and indignation will descend upon them wherever they go unless they grasp the rope of Allah and of mankind (Quran and Sunnah); the covenant of Allah and the duty of mankind to uphold that covenant. Some have said that the rope is Quran and Tabari on the authority of Abu Said said that the Prophet ﷺ said: 'The book of Allah is the rope of Allah which extends from the heavens to the earth.'

Ibn Kathir: Many Hadith have been narrated which prohibit the Ummah breaking off into factions. On the contrary, they've been commanded to be one group, as has occurred in Sahih Muslim [where the Prophet ﷺ says]: There are three things that would please Allah and three that would displease. Those that please are: 1) that you worship him and do not associate any partners with him; 2) that you hold onto the rope of Allah and you do not break off into factions; 3) that you advise sincerely those who Allah has given authority to as leaders over you. Those that displease are: 1) gossiping; 2) asking too many questions; 3) wasting wealth (excess or destruction [gambling, drugs, funding haraam work]).

Ibn Kathir: If the Ummah remains together, they will have protection ('Isma) from error as there are many Hadith that seem to suggest this. What is feared for them is breaking off into groups. And this has happened to the Ummah and the Ummah has been broken off into 70 sects, and amongst them is the Firqah Naajiya (the saved sect) who will enter Jannah. They are those who have preserved what Allah said and what the Messenger ﷺ has said [Consider: Qaidiyanis who don't accept the finality of the Prophet ﷺ; and Quranist movements who reject Hadith and Sunnah. Even among those who do claim Quran and Sunnah, differences have still formed. Consider what degree of fundamental it is that has determined your relationship to Islam. If you reject these first degrees, that makes you kafir. If you reject the second degree, you makes you mubtad'i (someone who has done bid'ah), taking you out of the fold of Ahlul Sunnah wa Jama'ah like: the Jabariya who say there is no free will at all; and the Shia'a who reject the leadership of Abu Bakr. If you differ on the third degree subsidiaries (furu'), that leads you to having a madhab, but they were the result of a sincere intention and that includes you in the saved sect. Ibn Kathir mentions Ikhtilaf but that's what explain differences in the third degree but it's rather khilaf we need to look at, for which Mufradaat al-Faadh al-Quran provides a definition. Ikhtilaf, here, tends to be on something very specific. Sheikh Awwaama says it is to take two separate paths but the intent is one or to arrive at one conclusion. Khilaf is where both the path and either the intent or conclusion are different. In ikhtilaf, the goal is one and the same, whereas this is not true of khilaf. Ikhtilaf stems from evidence whereas khilaf doesn't need to. Ikhtilaf is a mercy of Allah, whereas khilaf has the remnants of bid'ah inside it. If a judge makes a decision based on khilaf, it can be rejected and appealed, whereas a decision made on ikhtilaf cannot. On a number of occasions, there was difference from ikhtilaf in the Sahabah and the Prophet ﷺ endorsed it. You can also have difference in Aqidah in the third degree, as with the case of the Ascension].

Ibn Kathir: Among these divisions were the Aws and Khazraj, whose hatred against each other led to long battles. And so when they entered Islam, they became brothers and loved each other due to the majesty of Allah. And there were those who now were ready to maintain ties and to help each other from piety and Taqwa. And they became brothers. 'He is the one that helped you with victory and caused their hearts to come together' (Surah Anfaal: 62). Allah guided them to faith and the Messenger ﷺ reminded the Ansar on the day of the battle of Hunain and its separation of war booty, that despite their unhappiness at the division, it was Allah that divided the spoils. 'O Ansar, did I not find you divided, and Allah brought you hearts together through me?; and you were poor and impoverished, and were you not brought together through me?'

وَلۡتَكُنۡ مِّنۡكُمۡ اُمَّةٌ يَّدۡعُوۡنَ اِلَى الۡخَيۡرِ وَيَاۡمُرُوۡنَ بِالۡمَعۡرُوۡفِ وَيَنۡهَوۡنَ عَنِ الۡمُنۡكَرِ​ؕ وَاُولٰٓٮِٕكَ هُمُ الۡمُفۡلِحُوۡنَ‏ ١٠٤

Mufti Taqi: There has to be a group of people from among you who call towards the good, and bid the Fair and forbid the Unfair. And it is these who are successful.

  
Saheeh International: And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong,1 and those will be the successful.

  
Ibn Kathir: In telling us who are the group that enjoined us in enjoying the good and forbidding the evil, we are told they are the sahabah and the ulama. The intention of this ayah is to indicate that there will always be a group of Muslims who are enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, although it is sahib on every individual to do so, as has been established in Hadith: 'Whomsoever sees an evil, let him stop it with his hands, and if he is unable to do so, then let him change it with his tongue, and if he is unable to do so, let him change it with his heart, and that is the weakest form of imaan.' There is an addition to this in one account: 'and beyond this, there is no imaan, even at the weight of a mustard seed'.

It's 'azam (a resolute decision that you make plans for) for which you're sinful, not fleeting (ham) or lingering thoughts (khaatir), nor kham (when you consider it). If you turn away from 'azam due to Allah then you're forgiven but if you turn away for the dunya, you are not. But this all relates to the thought behind actions. When the thought is the action, and you, for instance, hate Allah, then that is haraam. You can never convince yourself that haraam or kufr is good, but as per this Hadith, the least you can do is to despise this kufr or the haraam in your hearts.

Ibn Kathir: Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal narrates, that the Prophet ﷺ said: '[...] That you most definitely should enjoin the good, and you should most definitely forbid the evil, or otherwise Allah will almost send upon you a punishment from him, and then even if you were to supplicate, He would not respond to you.' The Hadith is Hassan. 

This links to ham an-Nabi ﷺ (desires of the Prophet ﷺ), where the Prophet ﷺ wished something despite never doing it. The notion that Allah would have done something but ultimately does not illustrates that while the action is not fardh of the highest order, it is incumbent at least in some degree.

وَلَا تَكُوۡنُوۡا كَالَّذِيۡنَ تَفَرَّقُوۡا وَاخۡتَلَفُوۡا مِنۡۢ بَعۡدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ الۡبَيِّنٰتُ​ؕ وَاُولٰٓٮِٕكَ لَهُمۡ عَذَابٌ عَظِيۡمٌۙ‏ ١٠٥

Translation: Don't be like those who break off into factions and differ after clear proofs have been put forward. For them is a grave punishment.

Ibn Kathir: Hadith: We performed Hajj with Muawia (r.a), the son of Sufyan. When we came to Makkah, he stood up after Dhuhr, and he said that indeed, the Messenger said: 'Indeed the Ahlul Kitaab broke off into factions, and they broke off into 72 sects. As for this Ummah, it will soon break off into 73 sects due to their desires. All but one will be in the fire. And this is the majority group. And indeed soon there will emerge from my Ummah a people who will be driven by their desires as rabies drives its sufferers. There will not remain a single vein, nor artery, nor bone, nor joint, except that this rabies will enter it. O Arabs, if you do not stand by what the Prophet ﷺ has given you, then others have less reason to stand by Islam.

Ibn Kathir: On the day when the faces of the Ahlul Sunnah wa Jama'ah will be whitened and the others will be blackened, [...] this will be the day when those who are blackened will be questioned why they disbelieved when the truth was revealed to them. And on that day, they will taste the same punishment they rejected. This description encompasses all disbelievers.

Ibn Kathir: As for those whose faces will be whitened and brightened, they will reside in Jannah for entirety. They will remain in its for eternity and they shall not desire any change [to leave]. Hadith: Tirmidh -> Abu Umama saw the leaders (khawarij who left 'Ali after the conflict with Muawia; believed most of the Sahabah were kaafir and that major sins take you out the fold of Islam; enslaved many of their children) hanging around the streets of Damascus. Abu Umama said: 'they are the dogs of the fire'. The most evil of people under the canopy of the heavens are the khawarij. And the best of the murdered are those slain by the khawarij. Abu Umama then reads this ayah of some faces being white and others blackened. [...] When questioned, Abu Umama says that he heard of the dogs of Jahannam upto seven times. Tirmidhi grades this Hassan.

Ibn Kathir: 'These are the signs of Allah. We recite them to you with truth'. We reveal to you what are the commands of this earth. 'Allah does not intend to punish his creation'; He is not an oppressor. He is one who is fair and just, and does not terrorise. He is able to do anything and is not in need of oppression.

## #آل-عمران٣-١١٠

<p align="right"> كُنۡتُمۡ خَيۡرَ اُمَّةٍ اُخۡرِجَتۡ لِلنَّاسِ تَاۡمُرُوۡنَ بِالۡمَعۡرُوۡفِ وَتَنۡهَوۡنَ عَنِ الۡمُنۡكَرِ وَتُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ بِاللّٰهِ​ؕ وَلَوۡ اٰمَنَ اَهۡلُ الۡكِتٰبِ لَڪَانَ خَيۡرًا لَّهُمۡ​ؕ مِنۡهُمُ الۡمُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ وَاَكۡثَرُهُمُ الۡفٰسِقُوۡنَ‏ ﻿﻿ ١١٠</p>

Translation: You (believers) are the best Ummah, extracted from the people. You enjoin the good and you forbid the evil, and you believe in Allah. If the Ahlul Kitaab had believed, it would have been better for them. From amongst them are believers but the majority are grave sinners.  
  
Remember the rights to ourselves, the rights to Allah and the rights to other people, and with all of these, also remember our duties, responsibilities and how we go about fulfilling these rights to others. It's in this that we enjoin the good and forbid the evil.  
  
Also remember the distinction between khilaaf (neither same source nor the same roots - impermissible) and ikhtilaaf (two different routes that stem from the same source - permissible and expected). If we continue the discussion on deviation and the production of different groups.  
  
'Extracted from the people' is an adjective of the ummah, while enjoining the good, forbidding the evil, and believing in Allah are haal; they describe the manner. Kana also provides continuity, and in this context we know that the audience are Sahabah and then us. So we know that fi'l maadin is not being used for the past but for tathabbut. It's as though it has already happened

Ibn Kathir: The best of the people are for the people. They bring people with arms drawn on their necks / capture. [Much of what the orientalists opposed of Islam was that the Prophet ﷺ was seen as a warlord]. And this is what Ibn Abbas and others have said. That they were the best of people, for the people. And the meaning is that they were the best of nations, and the most beneficial of people to the people [they would free from oppression, liberate, give Islam, enjoin the good, forbid the evil, bring financial prosperity]. And so Allah says, they enjoin the good, forbid the evil, and believe in Allah, making them the best of people.

Ibn Kathir: On the authority of the daughter of Abu Lahab, Durra [All her siblings became Muslim. After Durra became Muslim and went to Madinah, at the house of Raafi, some of the women there asked her 'Are you the daughter of Abu Lahab? Whose father's hands will be in the fire?' And the Prophet ﷺ said 'O you people, what's wrong with you that you would harm my family? For indeed my intercession will encompass my family.'], the Prophet ﷺ says: 'The best of people are those who are the most learned of them [of the Quran]. And they have the most taqwa, and those who enjoin the good and forbid the evil. And they maintain the ties of kinship.'

Ibn Kathir: Ahmad al Hanbali and others' narration: Ibn Abbas: This refers to those who have migrated from Makkah to Madinah but it's true for people more generally. [...] The best of generations are the Prophet's ﷺ, then those that follow, then those that follow. [...] Allah sent him ﷺ with a sharia that he did not send to any prophet before him. Such is the honour of the Messenger ﷺ that to follow in his pathway, its darajah is so high that a little action of what he does is tantamount to a lot of what others have done. A little of it stands in place of what a big action does not stand of the actions of others in their place. That means, the small actions of this ummah are tantamount to the big actions of the earlier generations. Hadith: 'I was given what no other Prophet was given'. So the Sahabah asked, 'What did you receive?' and the Prophet ﷺ replies, 'I was given victory through fear and I was given the keys of the Earth. And I was named Ahmed and the soil of the Earth was made pure for me [previous ummahs didn't have the ahkam of tayammum].' The isnaad is hassan.

Ibn Kathir: On the night of the ascension, the Prophet ﷺ describes seeing many prophets, some without any believers and others with just a few until he came to Musa, who had many with him. He looked to his right and there was a mountain covered with people. He looked to his left and saw the whole horizon covered with people. When asking for his ummah, it was said to him ﷺ: 'Are you happy?', and he ﷺ replied positively. And it was said to him, 'Amongst these people will be 70,000 people who will enter Jannah without any accountability' (hisaab). [He tells the sahabah if they can't be of the 70k, then they should try to be of the horizon. One of the sahabah, Ukasha got so excited that he stood up and asks the Prophet ﷺ to make due for him to be of the 70k but he says: 'Ukasha has preceded you'. He doesn't do it for everyone.] Speaking amongst themselves, the sahabah ask each other, 'How do we know who the 70,000 will be?' and they assume that it must be those who are born in Islam, who associate no partners, and who die in that state. This news then reaches the Prophet and he says to them that these 70k are those who don't quarterise wounds, seek ruqya, nor use omens [they don't seek help in any means]. Rather, they have pure tawakkul 'ala Allah.

Ibn Kathir: We also have a Hadith in Bukhari and Muslim of the same meaning. The Prophet ﷺ says that a group of my Ummah will enter paradise and they will be 70,000. Their faces will be brightened and whitened like the light shining from the moon on the night of a full moon. It's also said that Ukasha stood up and he raised a mark (to draw the Prophet's attention), and asked for his duas to make him from amongst them. And the Prophet ﷺ makes that dua. Then an Ansari asks the same, and it's said Ukasha preceded you in this.

Muslim narrates on the authority of Hussain ibn Abd al-Rahman: 'I was with Said ibn Jubayr who said, 'Which one of you saw the star yesterday, which was shooting?' I said, 'I did'. Then I said, 'As for me, I was not able to pray salah because I was stunned. I was stung by a snake and sought ruqya to be cured from this bite.' And Hussayn responds, 'Why did you do that?' I said, 'A Hadith Sha'bi narrated to us'. And Said ibn Jubayr asks 'What did Sha'bi narrate?' It was, 'There is no ruqya but in two cases: for the evil eye, 'ayn, or being stung by a poisonous creature.'

The reason for all these Hadith is to do tafsir of this simple point that his Ummah is khayr an-Nas. We're being told there are three levels:

1.  The people of the horizon (most of the ummah)
2.  The people of the hillock (higher in rank)
3.  The people of the 70,000 (highest level - no hisaab)

It has been said, however, that anything that uses the number 7 usually refers to a large number of people; it's not necessarily a strict 70,000. The focal point is that these 70,000 have utter reliance on Allah and they will abstain from seeking help from others because their reliance is so high. It's worth noting that the word quarterise is used rather than describing all medical care. Quarterising is burning flesh but the recommendation here is that you don't need to go for the assistance that is immediate but potentially harmful. Remember that it's Allah that is curing you and don't rely on the most immediate of responses. 

Hadith: 'Would it please you to know that a third of inhabitants of Jannah would be you (the Muslims)?' (Important because of all the people that came before). And so the sahabah did takbir. 'However, I hope (make dua and the Prophet's dua will be accepted ﷺ) that all of you will be half of the inhabitants of Paradise.' 'We will be the last [from the last Prophet] and the first [to enter Paradise] on the Day of Judgement.' The order follows just as Friday, the day Muslims hold dear, precedes Saturday (Jews), and those of Sunday (Christians). 

Ibn Kathir: All of these Hadith are in the commentate of 'You are the best Ummah, selected from the people -> and you believe in Allah'. So whomsoever can be described with these descriptions in the Ummah, they will be included in this group. And those that don't forbid the evil [...], most of them are misguided.

لَنۡ يَّضُرُّوۡكُمۡ اِلَّاۤ اَذًى​ؕ وَاِنۡ يُّقَاتِلُوۡكُمۡ يُوَلُّوۡكُمُ الۡاَدۡبَارَ ثُمَّ لَا يُنۡصَرُوۡنَ‏ ١١١

Translation: O believers, don't fret. They can't harm you except for a little. And if they fight you, they will flee, turning their backs on you, then they shall not be helped in any case.

Ibn Kathir: Then The Exalted informs his believing servants and gives them glad tidings of victory and success, that they will enjoy over the Ahlul Kitaab, those that disbelieve, and those that have atheistic tendencies. [Is modern day atheism a product of failed Christianity?] They shall not harm but for a trifling hurt and when they fight you, they shan't be helped. For indeed on the Battle of Khaybar, Allah humiliated them [because they lost] and crushed their nose [lost all honour and respect / an expression of humiliation], even the Christians in Sham. The Sahabah defeated them in many locations. They took the authority of Sham from them, and never will they ever be able to take that authority back. And always there will be a group that remain in Sham until the arrival of Isa, and he will govern by the sharia of Muhammad ﷺ and he will break the cross, and slay the swine, and reinforce the jizya (tax), and he will only accept Islam.

<p align="right">ضُرِبَتۡ عَلَيۡهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ اَيۡنَ مَا ثُقِفُوۡۤا اِلَّا بِحَبۡلٍ مِّنَ اللّٰهِ وَحَبۡلٍ مِّنَ النَّاسِ وَبَآءُوۡ بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ اللّٰهِ وَضُرِبَتۡ عَلَيۡهِمُ الۡمَسۡكَنَةُ  ؕ ذٰ لِكَ بِاَنَّهُمۡ كَانُوۡا يَكۡفُرُوۡنَ بِاٰيٰتِ اللّٰهِ وَيَقۡتُلُوۡنَ الۡاَنۡۢبِيَآءَ بِغَيۡرِ حَقٍّ​ؕ ذٰ لِكَ بِمَا عَصَوۡا وَّكَانُوۡا يَعۡتَدُوۡنَ‏ ﻿﻿ ١١٢</p>

Wherever they have been found, they have been struck with humiliation, except when they have held tight onto the rope of Allah and when they are under the covenant of mankind. And they have gained nothing but the wrath of Allah. They have been struck with poverty and destitution because they rejected the aayat of Allah and they slayed the prophets without any right, unjustly. And that is because they disobeyed and used to transgress the limits.

Then Allah says that they were struck with humiliation wherever they are found except by the rope of Allah and the rope of mankind. Ibn Kathir explains that Allah strikes them wherever they are and they are not safe except by these ropes, meaning that they are under the dhimmah / the contract of responsibility (covenant). And it's also by being struck with the jizya tax, and by ruling with the rulings of the creed. They will only find safety in the covenant of Allah or by remaining within its rulings. They have a treaty with them like we have treaties for those who flee and those who are prisoners of war. If any Muslim has a treaty with a Jew or Christian, then they cannot be harmed. They will be protected if anyone comes to do so. The wrath of Allah became laazim upon them and they deserve it. The humiliation was struck upon them by the decree and sharia of Allah. They were meant to be humiliated for their sins. Because they used to reject the aayat of Allah and slay the Prophets without due right. Why did they do this? Due to haughtiness, pride, and rebellion, and therefore, they are destined to receive this humiliation from Allah, not just in this life but in the hereafter. Allah then says it's because they disobeyed and transgressed.

 ۞ لَـيۡسُوۡا سَوَآءً ​ؕ مِنۡ اَهۡلِ الۡكِتٰبِ اُمَّةٌ قَآٮِٕمَةٌ يَّتۡلُوۡنَ اٰيٰتِ اللّٰهِ اٰنَآءَ الَّيۡلِ وَ هُمۡ يَسۡجُدُوۡنَ‏ ١١٣

They are not [all] the same; among the People of the Scripture is a community standing [in obedience], reciting the verses of Allah during periods of the night and prostrating [in prayer].  
— Saheeh International

  
Not all of them are alike: Among the people of the Book there are those who are steadfast; they recite the verses of Allah in the night hours, and they prostrate themselves;  
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

  
But they are not all alike. There are some among the People of the Book who are upright, who recite God’s revelations during the night, who bow down in worship,  
— Abdul Haleem

We know here 'They' is referring to the Ahlul Kitaab because it's a continuation from the aayat beforehand. There are righteous people among them and they recite the verses of Allah throughout the night and they prostrate. اٰنَآءَ is a dharf zamaan, coming from the roots, hamza, nun, yaa, meaning throughout. Although it doesn't specify whether they are Muslim, the tafsir have generally agreed that this applies to those who have become Muslim. However, leaving it open does allow the idea that those who believe in the aayat as truth are among the righteous in some way; they won't have the same blame as those who rejected it. But then, if they believe in the Prophet, they are Muslim, so why are they being referred to as Ahlul Kitaab? It could be because of the bloodline, given that they are the Isra'iliyaat. The Qur'an could intend here to tell you not to judge all of that bloodline as some of them have become Muslim. It could also potentially refer to the Ahlul Kitaab in our time who haven't had Islam come to them fairly.

They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds. And those are among the righteous.

They believe in Allah and the Hereafter, and bid the Fair and forbid the Unfair, and hasten towards good deeds. They are among the righteous.  
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

  
Who believe in God and the Last Day, who order what is right and forbid what is wrong, who are quick to do good deeds. These people are among the righteous  
— Abdul Haleem

A major difference between the believer and the disbeliever is whether they enjoin the good and forbid the evil or not. In amongst the Ahlul Kitaab are people who do all these things. In the tafsir, the Arabic translation adds that all of the good and all of the wrong are included in enjoining and forbidding.

And whatever good they do - never will it be denied them. And Allah is Knowing of the righteous.  
— Saheeh International

  
Whatever good they do, they shall never go unappreciated for it. Allah is All-Aware of the God-fearing.  
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

  
And they will not be denied [the reward] for whatever good deeds they do: God knows exactly who is conscious of Him.  
— Abdul Haleem

The Arabic translation adds: whatever good deeds they do, be it small or plenty, they shall never be lost in the sight of Allah but rather kept as gratitude. They'll be recompensed for it. These are people who distance from the bad and seek reward.

Ibn Kathir mentions three of the Ahlul Kitaab who are examples of the righteous, all three of whom were rabbis, including Abdullah ibn Salaam, who had been one of the heads of the rabbis, Asad ibn 'Ubaid of the Quraidh, and Tha'liba ibn Sa'ya, Asad's father, whose brother also became Muslim. Sa'ya was a famous Jewish poet who wasn't alive for Islam. On a Qira' point, some recite the start as 'they' and others as 'you'.

The example of what they spend in this worldly life is like that of a wind containing frost which strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves [i.e., sinned] and destroys it. And Allah has not wronged them, but they wrong themselves.

At this point, we read through Adil Salahi's 'Muhammad: Man and Prophet' on the Battle of Uhud. At the point where the Muslims had taken down the flag bearer, Ikrimah, on his left flank, was failing to win with his horsemen and the archers on the Muslim left were beating Khalid ibn Waleed's horsemen on their right, so the archers thought the war had finished as the opposition had started to leave. The archers abandoned their post and went to the war booty, even though the Prophet had said that even if they were dead to the point of being eaten by the crows, they shouldn't leave their hill, but regardless, Khalid ibn Waleed then realises he can attack and they win the fight at that point. The Muslims then become sandwiched between forces and the Prophet is attacked on multiple occasions. The sahabah protect him there. After managing to save the Prophet, they sought shelter from the mountain by backing up into there. The rumour then spreads that the Prophet has been slain.

However, at that point, they were all overcome by sleep and they fell into a slumber / a light sleep. This sleep is called Qaylulah (like a power nap) and with that momentary sleep, they woke up to the shedding of a burden, with a blessing from God as though they were completely re-energised. The ayah will be coming up in Ali 'Imran, relating to the refreshed mind.

This is referring to before the battle when the 300 left, led by Abdullah ibn Ubay ibn Salul (Ra's al-Munafiqun). The Prophet didn't want to go the battle at this point but rather to hold Madinah and let them attack there. The Prophet eventually agreed to go out. One of those that adamantly didn't want to go out to fight was Abdullah ibn Ubay ibn Salul. He was a man who accepted Islam outwardly but not inwardly. He is the head of the hypocrites and is the foremost of those referenced when the Quran refers to the munafiqun. There was a point when his own son came to the Prophet to ask for permission to strike his father's head off, and on another instance Umar r.a. asked how we can put up with him but the Prophet responded that he wouldn't be known as the one who killed his own people. He was also the same guy fanning the flames against A'isha r.a. when accusations came against her. The ruling of false accusation came at that point. Four witnesses who see a crime with their eyes and cannot falter are required for an accusation. The Quran unequivocally wipes the slate clean for A'isha.

In terms of the battles of the period, there were some missions before the Battle of Badr. In The Sealed Nectar, you can simply look at the contents and find it all in there. The Battle of Khandaq (trenches) is also known as The Battle of Ahzab (groups / confederations).

There were three tribes of Jews:

Banu Qaynuqah (before Uhud, they try to assassinate the Prophet and get expelled from Madinah)

Banu Nadir (expelled after Uhud but before Khandaq)

Banu Qurayzah (expelled immediately after Khandaq for trying to help the mushrikeen)

### What is Ribā?

![[130-136. Riba.png]]

Notes from Mufti Taqi Usmani, who is at the forefront of dealing with Islamic finance. It's from Chapter 2 of the book, but no idea what the book is. Imam Jasas, whose definition is mention, is Hanafi. He describes it as: a loan that you give which has a deferred payment and has an excess amount of return. This type of riba is called riba of the Quran because it is what the Quran prohibits. Then the Prophet sa added another type of riba. And this is called Riba al-Fadhl (increase / surplus) or Riba al-Nasiyyat (deferred payment). The principle of Riba al-Fadhl is derived from the Hadith:

'Gold in exchange for gold, silver in exchange for silver, wheat in exchange for wheat, barley in exchange for wheat, dates in exchange for dates, salt (seasoning) in exchange for salt, and like for like, hand to hand. [It has to be an equal amount and an immediate payment.] Whomsoever seeks an increase has committed riba. The one who takes and the one who gives is the same.'

The two types of riba are money and commodity. Riba comes from ra, ba, ya, meaning to profit or to gain. Some of the earlier texts say that it's to earn an increase without breaking a sweat. If you take an increase where you're not allowed to, that is riba but that doesn't mean things like a service charge. You can't stipulate a return, although you can have a separate service charge. When riba applies for commodities, there's a discussion about whether they're the same genus. If they are, or if measured in the same way, then you cannot sell that at a higher price and you cannot accept it at a higher price.  But if they're not from the same genus or measurement, like swapping wheat for gold, you can't trade in exact weight. There can then be delayed payment, but there can't when they're equivalent. Some ulama say you can only consider these six items like for like but the vast majority apply the principle to other commodities, and even money. If you sell it like for like, then you can't defer it and you can't sell it for a higher price.

There can then be a discussion about currency exchange. If you're doing it out of necessity then it can be permissible. However, if you're intending to make profit in the exchange, as with forex, there's a mixture of opinion. When it comes purely to money exchange for travel, you need money for survival in that country. It can be considered permissible. But with forex, some permit it and others have issues. Arguably the payment is delayed (although that's not really the issue given that it's almost immediately done; it'd be like buying an item online and waiting for the transaction to go through and be complete). However, these things crucially cause volatility in the market, which is what Mufti Taqi says makes it haram. So, for instance, forex doesn't have to be haram but short-selling would most likely be haram. There is scope for Muslims to make money from all of these items but it is a tricky ground. Is it possible to sell something that does not exist? That has no benefit? That has uncertainty? There are heavy conditions around trade. You can't say outright that investing in stocks and shares is haram but you also can't claim it all to be permissible. There is an understanding that things grow in value. The market needs to be regulated in a manner so that it doesn't become oppressive. When it comes to day trading, however, it's very much akin to gambling and the personality becomes akin to a gambler's. It can also burn through your money very easily, and most of the time, you simply guess at the value of stock.

Finally, there's the discussion of mortgages. The concept of a mortgage, where you raise money by offering an object of value as a security, is not haram. It is providing the loan-giver a sense of security in what happens if there is an inability to repay. Pawnbroking, at a fundamental level, has worked in a similar way. The bank will expect you to have a stake in buying a house, so you pay that deposit and you share the house. Then you make a contract for the payments, and if you fail to pay, the bank can repossess the house because that has been kept as the security. Up to this point, it's fine. But, the banks then include an interest amount, where you don't repay just the price, but the money on top is riba, and it is haram. It becomes haram because it has the riba element. If that element can be removed, then the mortgage can be halal. Mudaraba and Mushaaraka systems exist to diminish. In the latter, you and the bank enter as partners on the house. You then draft a second contract where you live in the house as a tenant and pay a monthly payment to the bank. I then pay the bank a monthly amount to purchase their share, which continuously goes down, and I also pay them rent. Their share decreases as time goes on and my share increases. The result can be very similar to a conventional mortgage but the difference is that the risk is shared. If the market fluctuates, we will both be effected. In usual banking, the risk is not shared. Shari'a shares the risk; it's the Islamic solution to the problem. These systems have existed in the time of the Sahabah. However, the question of full compliance from Islamic banks is very different because the financial system in the UK doesn't allow full shari'a compliance. So what we have, is the next best thing. It's the last option, and insha'Allah, Allah will forgive. But you can also get the mainstream mortgage out of necessity. The mortgage enables the end of housing payments, which can produce permissibility. But you should be given a fatwa to justify because this is all about permissibility for a specific context. Having a house is a basic right, so enabling that is a fundamental. In the UK, the rental market being largely unregulated makes that money difficult. A mortgage allows the money to build up for you but when it's just rent, not having a mortgage steals away that security, and when you don't have the financial stability to secure the presence of a house if you lose that money, then you need to be able to develop a backup. Month to month survival requires a lot of consistent money so the mortgage allows you to build a backup while you do that but rent is much more expensive. When you mention the Hadith about necessity, you need to consider what necessity means for different people. Having a second mortgage for business purposes, however, is very likely to be haram. But you need to have the fatwa, because it could, at a stretch, be haram. Taking a loan to build an extension will be a lot less permissible. It's possible that, within that contract, a remortgage may be permissible but it'd be very difficult to ensure that these things become part of the principle of necessity. There's a difference between doing it to have a house to live in and doing it to live your luxury. In Germany, for instance, the rental market is very well regulated, so buying houses will most likely be impermissible because necessity is much less likely to apply.

Mufti Taqi also says you can take a credit card if you have a stable job and can pay it off. But you shouldn't incur the riba. Most of the time, if you pay it the month after, then you're good (no interest). It should, however, be done for darura (necessity).

### Tafsir ibn Kathir

Heracles wrote to the Prophet and said, 'Indeed you've invited me to a Paradise whose width is the extent of the heavens and the Earth. If that's the case, where's / what's the extent of the fire?' So the Prophet writes back and says 'Where is the day when the night comes?' That question about where Jahannam is, if Jannah is so vast that it covers all space, is responded to through the argument that day continues to exist while the night comes. This is in Tabari. Another narration gives you night and day as the same metaphor as well. In another narration, the night is said to be wherever Allah wishes it to be. The first view is that we can't witness the night when the day comes, and then it follows that it may not exist. In the way that light recedes in one place and remains in another, Jannah is in one place and elsewhere is the fire. The day, when it covers the earth from one side, then the night will cover the earth from the other side. Jannah is at the highest point of the heavens and earth but it's below the 'arsh of Allah. 'If you ask Allah about Paradise, ask him about Firdaus, for it's the highest Jannah, and it's in the middle.' This has all been modelled as a dome. 'And from it the rivers of Jannah flow, and the roof of Firdaus is the throne of Allah.' The width of Jannah is as Allah ta'ala says, 'like the width of the heavens and the earth.' The fire doesn't challenge the notion that Jannah is the width of the heavens and the earth.

It is not the choice of a person to die without the will of Allah, death being a time-bound destiny. Whoever seeks a reward in this world, We shall give him out of it, and whoever seeks a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give him out of it. We shall soon reward the grateful.

Allah has surely fulfilled His promise to you when you, with His will, were killing them off, until you showed weakness and disputed in the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you liked.Among you there were some who were seeking the mundane, and among you there were others who were seeking the Hereafter. After that, He reversed your position against them, so that He may test you. Of course, He has forgiven you. Allah is All-Gracious to the believers.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


God fulfilled His promise to you: you were routing them, with His permission, but then you faltered, disputed the order, and disobeyed, once He had brought you within sight of your goal- some of you desire the gains of this world and others desire the world to come- and then He prevented you from [defeating] them as a punishment.

Then, after the grief, He poured tranquility upon you - a drowsiness overtaking a group of you. Another group was worrying about their own selves, harboring thoughts about Allah that were untrue - thoughts of ignorance. They were saying, “Is there anything in our hands?” Say, “The whole thing belongs to Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not disclose to you.They say, “If we had any say in the matter, we would not have been killed here.”Say, “If you were in your homes, those destined to be killed would have come out all the way to their (final) resting -places.” (All this was done) so that Allah may test your inner qualities and may purify what is in your hearts. Allah is All-Aware of what lies in the hearts.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


After sorrow, He caused calm to descend upon you, a sleep that overtook some of you. Another group, caring only for themselves, entertained false thoughts about God, thoughts more appropriate to pagan ignorance, and said, ‘Do we get a say in any of this?’ [Prophet], tell them, ‘Everything to do with this affair is in God’s hands.’ They conceal in their hearts things they will not reveal to you. They say, ‘If we had had our say in this, none of us would have been killed here.’ Tell them, ‘Even if you had resolved to stay at home, those who were destined to be killed would still have gone out to meet their deaths.’ God did this in order to test everything within you and in order to prove what is in your hearts. God knows your innermost thoughts very well.

O you who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brethren while they travelled on the earth or had to fight, “Had they been with us, they would have not died, nor would they have been killed.” The result is that Allah makes it a remorse resting in their hearts. Allah gives life and brings death; Allah is watchful of what you do.

You who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and said of their brothers who went out on a journey or a raid, ‘If only they had stayed with us they would not have died or been killed,’ for God will make such thoughts a source of anguish in their hearts.

So, (O Prophet) it is through mercy from Allah that you are gentle to them. Had you been rough and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So, pardon them, and seek Forgiveness for them. Consult them in the matter and, once you have taken a decision, place your trust in Allah. Surely, Allah loves those who place their trust in Him.

By an act of mercy from God, you [Prophet] were gentle in your dealings with them- had you been harsh, or hard-hearted, they would have dispersed and left you- so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them.
