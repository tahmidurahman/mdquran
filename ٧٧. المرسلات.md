ibn Masoud narrates that they were once with the Prophet ﷺ near Mina when a snake appeared. They said to kill it but the snake then leaves them. The purpose of this Hadith is to foreground the aspect of protection. In another narration, Umm al-Fadhl heard her son Abdullah ibn Abbas recite this and was crying. She explains that it was because it was one of the last surahs recited by the Prophet ﷺ in salah, during a Maghreb salah.

وَٱلْمُرْسَلَـٰتِ عُرْفًۭا ١

(I swear) by those (winds) that are sent one after the other,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


By the [winds] sent forth in swift succession,
— Abdul Haleem

Even amongst the earliest of scholars, there's a difference of opinion. Many interpreted it as angels, others as winds, and some argue that some verses are for winds while others are for angels. You can combine the perspectives because some of the angels have been assigned the tasks of winds, and rain and so forth. Things like the weather for instance are largely known to have been assigned to Mikaïl. The angels are part of the process that involves the winds. This is an oath by those winds.

# #المرسلات٧٧-٢
فَٱلْعَـٰصِفَـٰتِ عَصْفًۭا ٢

and by those that blow violently,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


violently storming,
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٣
وَٱلنَّـٰشِرَٰتِ نَشْرًۭا ٣

and by those that spread (clouds) all over,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


scattering far and wide,
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٤
فَٱلْفَـٰرِقَـٰتِ فَرْقًۭا ٤

and by those (angels) who differentiate (between right and wrong) distinctly,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


separating forcefully,
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٥
فَٱلْمُلْقِيَـٰتِ ذِكْرًا ٥

then bring down the advice,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


delivering a reminder,
— Abdul Haleem

There's a Hadith that when it would get cloudy and windy / gusty, the Prophet ﷺ would hasten to the masjid because it would remind him of the punishment. It is then a type of reminder.

# #المرسلات٧٧-٦
عُذْرًا أَوْ نُذْرًا ٦

leaving no excuse (for the disbelievers) or giving warnings,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


as a proof or a warning:
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٧
إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَٰقِعٌۭ ٧

that which you are promised is sure to happen.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


what you are promised will come to pass.
— Abdul Haleem


This discussion of angels vs winds that has come in this first section also comes up in Nazi'at. The versatility of the Qur'an shows in this discussion because we see how the light of religion and the stages of your emaan, depending on the knowledge you have, have shaped understandings. It's just as understandable as winds as it is with angels, as it is with both, and recognising all gives you yet another way of understanding.

# #المرسلات٧٧-٨
فَإِذَا ٱلنُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ ٨

So, when the stars will be extinguished,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


When the stars are dimmed
— Abdul Haleem

The Bedouins of the desert appreciated the stars greatly. These were guides for the desert at the time. When mention of the stars being taken comes then, the end of everything resonates even stronger.

# #المرسلات٧٧-٩
وَإِذَا ٱلسَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ ٩

and when the sky will be split,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and the sky is torn apart,
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-١٠
وَإِذَا ٱلْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ ١٠

and when the mountains will be blown away as dust,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


when the mountains are turned to dust
— Abdul Haleem

In another surah, there's mention that when the first heaven is torn apart, all the angels come down, ranks on ranks. 

# #المرسلات٧٧-١١
وَإِذَا ٱلرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ ١١

and when the messengers will be assembled at the appointed time, (then all matters will be decided.)
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and the messengers given their appointed time––
— Abdul Haleem

The Messengers of each nation will be given their time. Everything of the revelations that came through them will be used to judge their people.

# #المرسلات٧٧-١٢
لِأَىِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ ١٢

(Do you know) for which day has all this been delayed?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


for what Day has all this been set?
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-١٣
لِيَوْمِ ٱلْفَصْلِ ١٣

For the Day of Decision!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


The Day of Decision.
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-١٤
وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا يَوْمُ ٱلْفَصْلِ ١٤

And what may let you know what the Day of Decision is?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


What will explain to you what the Day of Decision is?
— Abdul Haleem

With wa maa adraka, Allah t.a. goes on to explain it. There's another phrase that is wa maa yudrika, which is not followed by an explanation of it. There's no explanation and it's left with some ambiguity. It's also worth pointing out that it centres around this whole point that you won't understand what's going on. You can literally understand the words but you won't know the true meaning of it. Instead, we're made to have this feeling of woe. 

# #المرسلات٧٧-١٥
وَيْلٌۭ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ ١٥

Woe that Day to the deniers!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!
— Abdul Haleem

The same kind of repetition as you see in Surah Rahman comes up here. It's largely for emphasis. Some of the scholars mention that wayl refers to a specific valley in Jahannam, alongside woe to. It has then a link to the hellfire, so it means something along the lines of 'may Hell be upon'. It often expresses a distaste towards something. 

# #المرسلات٧٧-١٦
أَلَمْ نُهْلِكِ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ ١٦

Did We not destroy the earlier people?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Did We not destroy the first [of them]?
— Abdul Haleem

This is the first warning. It refers to the earlier generations and then says those that come will follow as such when they continue as their ancestors did. 

# #المرسلات٧٧-١٧
ثُمَّ نُتْبِعُهُمُ ٱلْـَٔاخِرِينَ ١٧

Then We will cause the later ones to follow them.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


We shall make the last follow them:
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-١٨
كَذَٰلِكَ نَفْعَلُ بِٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ ١٨

Thus We deal with the guilty people.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


this is how We deal with the guilty.
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-١٩
وَيْلٌۭ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ ١٩

Woe that Day to the deniers!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٠
أَلَمْ نَخْلُقكُّم مِّن مَّآءٍۢ مَّهِينٍۢ ٢٠

Did We not create you from a worthless fluid?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Did We not make you from an underrated fluid
— Abdul Haleem

This is that something that was not worth being mentioned that we spoke of at the start of Surah al-Insan. Muhin carries the meaning that it's not looked at in a positive way. This perspective on our beginnings, saying that we are created from nothing, has been repeated throughout juz 28 and 29.

# #المرسلات٧٧-٢١
فَجَعَلْنَـٰهُ فِى قَرَارٍۢ مَّكِينٍ ٢١

Then We put it in a firm place of rest
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


which We housed in a safe lodging
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٢
إِلَىٰ قَدَرٍۢ مَّعْلُومٍۢ ٢٢

for a known period.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


for a determined period?
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٣
فَقَدَرْنَا فَنِعْمَ ٱلْقَـٰدِرُونَ ٢٣

Thus We did (all this with perfect) measure; so We are the best to measure.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


We determine [it]: how excellently We determine!
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٤
وَيْلٌۭ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ ٢٤

Woe that Day to the deniers!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!
— Abdul Haleem

In every instance of this ayah, another aspect of creation is moved onto to that explored before it. In this instance, its the physical creation, having just spoken about the creation of you.

# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٥
أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ ٱلْأَرْضَ كِفَاتًا ٢٥

Did We not make the earth a container that collects
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Did We not make the earth a home
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٦
أَحْيَآءًۭ وَأَمْوَٰتًۭا ٢٦

the living and the dead?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


for the living and the dead?
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٧
وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا رَوَٰسِىَ شَـٰمِخَـٰتٍۢ وَأَسْقَيْنَـٰكُم مَّآءًۭ فُرَاتًۭا ٢٧

And We placed towering mountains therein, and provided you with sweet water to drink.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Did We not place firm, lofty mountains on it and provide you with sweet water?
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٨
وَيْلٌۭ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ ٢٨

Woe that Day to the deniers!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!
— Abdul Haleem

Furat also contains the meaning of bursting. There could be a link there to how much the water provides.

# #المرسلات٧٧-٢٩
ٱنطَلِقُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ مَا كُنتُم بِهِۦ تُكَذِّبُونَ ٢٩

(It will be said to them on that day,) “Push on to what you used to deny.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


They will be told, ‘Go to that which you used to deny!
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٣٠
ٱنطَلِقُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ ظِلٍّۢ ذِى ثَلَـٰثِ شُعَبٍۢ ٣٠

Push on to a canopy (of Hell’s smoke) having three branches,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Go to a shadow of smoke!’ It rises in three columns;

— Mufti Taqi Usmani


no shade does it give, nor relief from the flame;
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٣٢
إِنَّهَا تَرْمِى بِشَرَرٍۢ كَٱلْقَصْرِ ٣٢

It emits sparks (as huge) as castles,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


it shoots out sparks as large as treetrunks
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٣٣
كَأَنَّهُۥ جِمَـٰلَتٌۭ صُفْرٌۭ ٣٣

as if they were yellowish camels.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and as bright as copper.
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٣٤
وَيْلٌۭ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ ٣٤

Woe that Day to the deniers!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٣٥
هَـٰذَا يَوْمُ لَا يَنطِقُونَ ٣٥

This is the day when they will not speak,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


On that Day they will be speechless,
— Abdul Haleem



# #المرسلات٧٧-٣٦
وَلَا يُؤْذَنُ لَهُمْ فَيَعْتَذِرُونَ ٣٦

nor will they be allowed to offer excuses.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and they will be given no chance to offer any excuses.

Of course, the God-fearing will be amid shades and streams,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


But those who took heed of God will enjoy cool shade, springs,

# #المرسلات٧٧-٤٢
وَفَوَٰكِهَ مِمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ ٤٢

Now, in which discourse, after this, will they believe?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


In what revelation, after this, will they believe?
— Abdul Haleem

It's not often that a surah ends with a question, but here it's a reminder that there's not much truth beyond the Qur'an and the revelations.
