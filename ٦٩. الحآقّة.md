April 19th 2022 | Ustadh Farhan and Ustadh Shabbir
Judgement, Account and Punishment

This is a surah that captures the gravity of the akhirah and the consequences of this life. When contemplating the meanings of this surah, it can be really scary and can shock you quite thoroughly. Contemplate its meanings thoroughly with a good reciter.

# #الحاقة٦٩-١

ٱلْحَآقَّةُ ١

The Imminent Happening!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


The Inevitable Hour!
— Abdul Haleem

It may be better to leave it untranslated here because the assumption is that when the first Arab heard it, they wouldn't have known what it is. That's why the next ayah follows as a rhetorical question.

# #الحاقة٦٩-٢

مَا ٱلْحَآقَّةُ ٢

What is the Imminent Happening?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


What is the Inevitable Hour?
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣

وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا ٱلْحَآقَّةُ ٣

And what can let you know what the Imminent happening is?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


What will explain to you what the Inevitable Hour is?
— Abdul Haleem

This is about making us recognise not just the meaning of the Haqqah but also the gravity of it. It's said to refer to the Day of Reckoning. The scene here has been set for a very important discussion on Judgement, what leads to it, and its outcomes. Nothing is more serious that Haqqah; everything will stop and nobody will be doing anything else. It is the most inevitable day and its final hour. 

# #الحاقة٦٩-٤

كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ وَعَادٌۢ بِٱلْقَارِعَةِ ٤

Thamūd and ‘Ād had denied (the happening of) the Shocking Event (the Day of Judgment).
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


The people of Thamud and 'Ad denied that the crashing blowwould come:
— Abdul Haleem

As soon as the description begins, we have two nations who rejected the day of judgement. each of them were powerful nations. the great descendants of nuh a.s. who commanded great legions and authorities. 

# #الحاقة٦٩-٥

فَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَأُهْلِكُوا۟ بِٱلطَّاغِيَةِ ٥

As for Thamūd, they were destroyed by that (dreadful cry), which exceeded all limits.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Thamud was destroyed by a deafening blast;
— Abdul Haleem

A cry, a screeching, sonic sound, that caused their heads to burst, and they died. It's a very graphic image being painted. It's about them being utterly annihilated.

# #الحاقة٦٩-٦

وَأَمَّا عَادٌۭ فَأُهْلِكُوا۟ بِرِيحٍۢ صَرْصَرٍ عَاتِيَةٍۢ ٦

And as for ‘Ād, they were destroyed by a violent windstorm
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Ad was destroyed by a furious wind
— Abdul Haleem

It was so severely cold that they were destroyed by this wind.

# #الحاقة٦٩-٧

سَخَّرَهَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَبْعَ لَيَالٍۢ وَثَمَـٰنِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُومًۭا فَتَرَى ٱلْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَىٰ كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍۢ ٧

that He imposed on them for seven nights and eight consecutive days; so you could see them thrown on the ground, as if they were trunks of hollow palm-trees.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


that God let loose against them for seven consecutive nights, eight consecutive days, so that you could have seen its people lying dead like hollow palm-trunks.
— Abdul Haleem

The date-palm trees are strong in structure and very tall. The splattering of their heads was as the splattering of the leaves of a date-palm tree. This is taking a birds-eye-view, giving us the view of how their heads would have lain. This is about hundreds and thousands of them, all of them splattered in their legions. 

# #الحاقة٦٩-٨

فَهَلْ تَرَىٰ لَهُم مِّنۢ بَاقِيَةٍۢ ٨

Now, do you see any remnant of them?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Can you see any trace of them now?
— Abdul Haleem

This isn't just about seeing them specifically but it's about showing you that their lineage and every aspect of them was destroyed. Nothing remained. There are remnants of their buildings but nothing of them; nothing organic. Their presence is completely absent.


# #الحاقة٦٩-٩

وَجَآءَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَن قَبْلَهُۥ وَٱلْمُؤْتَفِكَـٰتُ بِٱلْخَاطِئَةِ ٩

And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and those before him and the overthrown towns came up with evil,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


And there came Pharaoh and those before him and the overturned cities with sin.
— Abdul Haleem

And here comes another discussion on another people considered to be powerful. They came, and their towns were overthrown, having brought sin with them. As a result of their sins, their towns were turned upside down and destroyed. But Pharaoh is identified because he was the most proud of all of them, having achieved a great many things from his perspective. Some of the Qirat read this as not those before him but those with him.

# #الحاقة٦٩-١٠

فَعَصَوْا۟ رَسُولَ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَخَذَهُمْ أَخْذَةًۭ رَّابِيَةً ١٠

and they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an extremely severe seizure.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


these people committed grave sins and disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an ever-tightening grip.
— Abdul Haleem

The message that they had disobeyed and disbelieved is that of the Day of Judgement. In another surah, there's reference to the severity of Judgement being that each mother suckling their child would forget their child in that moment. Given the extent of that commitment, the gravity of it is there. Those women that are pregnant will immediately abort their child. The gravity of the situation shows that no load will be bearable. All focus will be on the end.

# #الحاقة٦٩-١١

إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا ٱلْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـٰكُمْ فِى ٱلْجَارِيَةِ ١١

When the water overflowed (in the Deluge of NūH), We let you (O mankind,) board the floating ship,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


But when the Flood rose high, We saved you in the floating ship,
— Abdul Haleem

Here comes some respite. When Nuh as people rejected the messenger, those who listened were protected by giving them this ship.

# #الحاقة٦٩-١٢

لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةًۭ وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌۭ وَٰعِيَةٌۭ ١٢

so that We make it a reminder for you, and so that a preserving ear (that hears their story) may preserve it.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


making that event a reminder for you: attentive ears may take heed.
— Abdul Haleem

This incident is a precedence, recorded and preserved by the will of Allah, for us to be reminded of two things: 1) the annihilation of the oppressive disbelievers, and 2) that the righteous will be saved, even when the world is destroyed. The ship is a symbol of our salvation when we believe and are righteous. This is not a time to be heedless but a time to be extremely aware of al-Haqqah.

# #الحاقة٦٩-١٣

فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى ٱلصُّورِ نَفْخَةٌۭ وَٰحِدَةٌۭ ١٣

Then, once the Trumpet will be blown for the first time,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


When the Trumpet is sounded a single time,
— Abdul Haleem

And now the discussion begins. Everything that came before was the prelude. It mentions this trumpet blowing for the first time. This enormous trumpet will be placed in the hands of Israfil, a great angel. As soon as he was given this, he fixed his eyes on the arsh of Allah and his eyes have not left that sight since this initial moment because he's waiting for the commandment. For when that commandment comes, the trumpet will be blown and the end will come.

# #الحاقة٦٩-١٤

وَحُمِلَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ وَٱلْجِبَالُ فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةًۭ وَٰحِدَةًۭ ١٤

and the earth and the mountains will be lifted and crushed into pieces with a single blow,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


when the earth and its mountains are raised high and then crushed with a single blow,
— Abdul Haleem

Everything will crumble and fall to dust, with the whole Earth being entirely levelled. It's mentioned that we'll be like scattered moths too, flying everywhere in confusion.


# #الحاقة٦٩-١٥

فَيَوْمَئِذٍۢ وَقَعَتِ ٱلْوَاقِعَةُ ١٥

then on that Day the Happening will happen,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


on that Day the Great Event will come to pass.
— Abdul Haleem

The whole of reality will have been placed before you. It's the moment at which you'll be questioning nothing but whether you've done enough, because you can't procrastinate any more.

# #الحاقة٦٩-١٦

وَٱنشَقَّتِ ٱلسَّمَآءُ فَهِىَ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ وَاهِيَةٌۭ ١٦

and the sky will burst apart, while it will have become frail on that day.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


The sky will be torn apart on that Day, it will be so frail.
— Abdul Haleem

In Surah Mulk, there's mention that you will be fatigued but will find no discrepancies were they to gaze at the heavens. There are no cracks, but on this day, they will look scattered and they will start to crumble. This is the perpetual shaking that is mentioned as Zalzalah. It's not just an earthquake but much stronger. 

# #الحاقة٦٩-١٧

وَٱلْمَلَكُ عَلَىٰٓ أَرْجَآئِهَا ۚ وَيَحْمِلُ عَرْشَ رَبِّكَ فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ ثَمَـٰنِيَةٌۭ ١٧

And the angels will be on its borders. And on that Day, the Throne of your Lord will be carried above them by eight (angels).
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


The angels will be on all sides of it and, on that Day, eight of them will bear the throne of your Lord above them.
— Abdul Haleem


# #الحاقة٦٩-١٨

يَوْمَئِذٍۢ تُعْرَضُونَ لَا تَخْفَىٰ مِنكُمْ خَافِيَةٌۭ ١٨

On that day, you will be brought forward in a way that no secret of yours will remain secret.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


On that Day you will be brought to judgement and none of your secrets will remain hidden.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-١٩

فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـٰبَهُۥ بِيَمِينِهِۦ فَيَقُولُ هَآؤُمُ ٱقْرَءُوا۟ كِتَـٰبِيَهْ ١٩

Now, as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say (to his colleagues), “Come here, read my book.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


Anyone who is given his Record in his right hand will say, ‘Here is my Record, read it.
— Abdul Haleem

There's respite here for those who listened and who stood firm. They will be given their accountability in their right hands, which will be a sign that they were righteous people.

# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٠

إِنِّى ظَنَنتُ أَنِّى مُلَـٰقٍ حِسَابِيَهْ ٢٠

I was sure that I would encounter my reckoning.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


I knew I would meet my Reckoning,’
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٢١

فَهُوَ فِى عِيشَةٍۢ رَّاضِيَةٍۢ ٢١

So he will be in a well-pleasing life
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and so he will have a pleasant life
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٢

فِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍۢ ٢٢

in a lofty garden,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


in a lofty Garden,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٣

قُطُوفُهَا دَانِيَةٌۭ ٢٣

the fruits of which will be close at hand.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


with clustered fruit within his reach.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٤

كُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ هَنِيٓـًٔۢا بِمَآ أَسْلَفْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَيَّامِ ٱلْخَالِيَةِ ٢٤

(It will be said to such people,) “Eat and drink with pleasure, as a reward for what you did in advance during past days.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


It will be said, ‘Eat and drink to your heart’s content as a reward for what you have done in days gone by.’
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٥

وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـٰبَهُۥ بِشِمَالِهِۦ فَيَقُولُ يَـٰلَيْتَنِى لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَـٰبِيَهْ ٢٥

As for him who will be given his book in his left hand, he will say, “ Oh, would that I had not been given my book,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


But anyone who is given his Record in his left hand will say, ‘If only I had never been given any Record
— Abdul Haleem

'Layta' is for wishful thinking when you know it's either not possible or very unlikely. These people will know and there is nothing that can be done now. There's no opportunity to appeal. Everything is final. On that day, once they are given the books in their left hand, that's the end. They would only wish not to have been given the book. The only think to think about is escape.

# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٦

وَلَمْ أَدْرِ مَا حِسَابِيَهْ ٢٦

and I had never known what my account is!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and knew nothing of my Reckoning.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٧

يَـٰلَيْتَهَا كَانَتِ ٱلْقَاضِيَةَ ٢٧

Oh, would that it (death) had been the end of the matter!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


How I wish death had been the end of me.
— Abdul Haleem

You would wish at this point not to have existed, as though were sand. They're not asking for Paradise but simply to not exist so that they may escape punishment.

# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٨

مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنِّى مَالِيَهْ ۜ ٢٨

My wealth has not been of any use to me.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


My wealth has been no use to me,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٢٩

هَلَكَ عَنِّى سُلْطَـٰنِيَهْ ٢٩

My power has gone from me for good.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and my power has vanished.’
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٠

خُذُوهُ فَغُلُّوهُ ٣٠

(Then it will be said to angels,) “Seize him, then put a collar around his neck,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


‘Take him, put a collar on him,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣١

ثُمَّ ٱلْجَحِيمَ صَلُّوهُ ٣١

and then, let him burn in the blazing fire.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


lead him to burn in the blazing Fire,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٢

ثُمَّ فِى سِلْسِلَةٍۢ ذَرْعُهَا سَبْعُونَ ذِرَاعًۭا فَٱسْلُكُوهُ ٣٢

Thereafter, fasten him with a chain the measure of which is seventy hands.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and [bind him] in a chain seventy metres long:
— Abdul Haleem

The tafsir of this ayah from Hadith and other sources is extremely graphic. Huge iron chains will be placed through the whole gut of man from the anus up through the mouth. This is the severity of the punishment. Like this they'll be dragged into the punishment of Jahannam. 

# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٣

إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ ٣٣

Indeed, he did not believe in Allah, the Almighty,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


he would not believe in Almighty God,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٤

وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ ٱلْمِسْكِينِ ٣٤

and did not persuade (others) to feed the needy.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


he never encouraged feeding the hungry,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٥

فَلَيْسَ لَهُ ٱلْيَوْمَ هَـٰهُنَا حَمِيمٌۭ ٣٥

So, he has no friend here today,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


so today he has no real friend here,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٦

وَلَا طَعَامٌ إِلَّا مِنْ غِسْلِينٍۢ ٣٦

nor any food except that which comes out from wounds when washing,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and the only food he has is the filth
— Abdul Haleem

Some say ghisleen is a tree in Jahannam, but the most popular approach is that it's the bodily fluids of the people of Jahannam that will be released from them and given as food there. 

# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٧

لَّا يَأْكُلُهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱلْخَـٰطِـُٔونَ ٣٧

which is eaten by none but the sinners.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


that only sinners eat.’
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٨

فَلَآ أُقْسِمُ بِمَا تُبْصِرُونَ ٣٨

I swear by what you see,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


So I swear by what you can see
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٣٩

وَمَا لَا تُبْصِرُونَ ٣٩

and what you do not see,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and by what you cannot see:
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٠

إِنَّهُۥ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍۢ كَرِيمٍۢ ٤٠

it is surely the speech of a noble Messenger, (that he conveys from Allah).
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


this [Quran] is the speech of an honoured messenger,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٤١


وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍۢ ۚ قَلِيلًۭا مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ ٤١

and it is not the speech of a poet, (but) little you believe,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


not the words of a poet- how little you believe!-
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٢

وَلَا بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍۢ ۚ قَلِيلًۭا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ ٤٢

nor is it the speech of a soothsayer, (but) little you heed to the advice.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


nor the words of a soothsayer- how little you reflect!
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٣

تَنزِيلٌۭ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ ٤٣

It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


This [Quran] is a message sent down from the Lord of the Worlds:
— Abdul Haleem

Remember that the month of Ramadan is the month of the revelation. It's a time to take stock of your belief and your judgement. 

# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٤

وَلَوْ تَقَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا بَعْضَ ٱلْأَقَاوِيلِ ٤٤

Had he (the prophet) forged some statements in Our name,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


if [the Prophet] had attributed some fabrication to Us,
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٥

لَأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُ بِٱلْيَمِينِ ٤٥

We would have certainly seized him by the right hand,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


We would certainly have seized his right hand
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٦

ثُمَّ لَقَطَعْنَا مِنْهُ ٱلْوَتِينَ ٤٦

and then severed his life-artery,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and cut off his lifeblood,
— Abdul Haleem

It's said that the Prophet ﷺ would even have been held accountable were he to have lied with the message, so what would that have meant for us.

# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٧

فَمَا مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَـٰجِزِينَ ٤٧

and none of you could have saved him from it.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


and none of you could have defended him.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٨

وَإِنَّهُۥ لَتَذْكِرَةٌۭ لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ ٤٨

It is infact a Reminder for the God-fearing.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


This [Quran] is a reminder for those who are aware of God.
— Abdul Haleem

This is about Taqwa, the opposite of Ghaffla (heedlessness)

# #الحاقة٦٩-٤٩

وَإِنَّا لَنَعْلَمُ أَنَّ مِنكُم مُّكَذِّبِينَ ٤٩

And, of course, We know that among you there are deniers.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


We know that some of you consider it to be lies-
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٥٠

وَإِنَّهُۥ لَحَسْرَةٌ عَلَى ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ ٥٠

And surely, it is a cause of remorse for the disbelievers.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


this will be a source of bitter regret for the disbelievers-
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٥١

وَإِنَّهُۥ لَحَقُّ ٱلْيَقِينِ ٥١

And it is surely an absolute truth.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


but it is in fact the certain Truth.
— Abdul Haleem



# #الحاقة٦٩-٥٢

فَسَبِّحْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلْعَظِيمِ ٥٢

So, pronounce the purity of the name of your magnificent Lord.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani


So [Prophet] glorify the name of your Lord, the Almighty.
— Abdul Haleem

Subhanallah wa bi Hamdi. It's incumbent on you to exalt the name of the Lord, and a 100 times is good.

The believer should remain in a constant state of anxiety. There's nothing wrong with being happy and having some enjoyment but this life is temporary. We need to be concerned about meeting the creator. And ask yourself how prepared you are to meet your maker.
