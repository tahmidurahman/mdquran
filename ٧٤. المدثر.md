**Surah al-Muddaththir | Wealth, Pride and the Quraysh**
April 27th 2022 | Ustadh Farhan and Ustadh Shabbir

There was a pause in revelation called the fatrah very early on and it was anything between 15-40 days. Right at the start, this was quite a long time, especially since the mockery and the name-calling intensifies in this early period as well. This is the first surah to be revealed after the break in revelation.



# #المدثر٧٤-١


يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْمُدَّثِّرُ ١


O you who covers himself [with a garment],
— Saheeh International

O you, enveloped in a mantle,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

You, wrapped in your cloak,
— Abdul Haleem

The Prophet ﷺ isn't being called by his name but by a title that welcomes (and recognises this fear?).


# #المدثر٧٤-٢


قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ ٢

Arise and warn.
— Saheeh International

stand up and warn,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

arise and give warning!
— Abdul Haleem

This call to confidence calls on the Prophet ﷺ to give warning, rather than to be in his fear.


# #المدثر٧٤-٣


وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ ٣

And your Lord glorify.
— Saheeh International

and pronounce the greatness of your Lord,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

Proclaim the greatness of your Lord;
— Abdul Haleem

The emphasis is on what you put first. The maf'ul bihi, referring to Allah, comes first here. The command is to do Takbir.


# #المدثر٧٤-٤


وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ ٤

And your clothing purify.
— Saheeh International

and purify your clothes,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

cleanse yourself;
— Abdul Haleem

There's one meaning here which is to go a cleanse your garment quite literally, whereas another is that it's a spiritual purification. Both meanings apply.


# #المدثر٧٤-٥


وَٱلرُّجْزَ فَٱهْجُرْ ٥

And uncleanliness avoid.
— Saheeh International

and keep away from filth,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

keep away from all filth;
— Abdul Haleem

The filth is said to refer to the idols. It's about staying from that which is religiously impure.


# #المدثر٧٤-٦


وَلَا تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ ٦


And do not confer favor to acquire more.
— Saheeh International

and do not do a favour (to anyone merely) to seek more (in return).
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

do not be overwhelmed and weaken;
— Abdul Haleem

One meaning is to not over-exert yourself. Another is 'don't give in order to get something back'.


# #المدثر٧٤-٧


وَلِرَبِّكَ فَٱصْبِرْ ٧


But for your Lord be patient.
— Saheeh International

And for the sake of your Lord, observe patience.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

be steadfast in your Lord’s cause.
— Abdul Haleem

This is coming from the word Sabr.


# #المدثر٧٤-٨


فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى ٱلنَّاقُورِ ٨


And when the trumpet is blown,
— Saheeh International

For when the trumpet will be blown,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

When the Trumpet sounds,
— Abdul Haleem

This is the next section of the surah. It's bringing us to the Day of Judgement and the moment when everything is destroyed. The first trumpet is the destruction, and the second is everyone being brought back.


# #المدثر٧٤-٩


فَذَٰلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ ٩


That Day will be a difficult day
— Saheeh International

that day will be a difficult day,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

that will be a Day of anguish for the disbelievers.
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-١٠


عَلَى ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍۢ ١٠


For the disbelievers - not easy.
— Saheeh International

not easy for the disbelievers.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

They will have no ease.
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-١١


ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيدًۭا ١١

Leave Me with the one I created alone
— Saheeh International

Leave me alone (to deal) with the one whom I created lonely,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

[Prophet], leave Me to deal with the one I created helpless,
— Abdul Haleem

There are multiple interpretations. The verses do refer to one particular individual but they also apply more broadly. Usually the first person is not used to talk about the punishment but here it is.


# #المدثر٧٤-١٢


وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُۥ مَالًۭا مَّمْدُودًۭا ١٢


And to whom I granted extensive wealth
— Saheeh International

and gave him extensive wealth,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

then gave vast wealth,
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-١٣


وَبَنِينَ شُهُودًۭا ١٣

And children present [with him]
— Saheeh International

and sons present before (his) eyes,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

and sons by his side,
— Abdul Haleem

This is in reference to al-Waleed ibn al-Mugheerah of the Bani Makhzum. They became one of the most affluent clans, and al-Waleed was the most wealthy of the Bani Makhzum. It's said he had around ten sons as well. His son, al-Waleed ibn al-Waleed, an early Muslim, was at an early point asked about how Khalid was doing by the Prophet ﷺ and he replies that he's doing well. The Prophet ﷺ comments that he's surprised he hasn't accepted Islam because he's as intelligent as he is. And al-Waleed writes to Khalid after this, quoting what was said. And Khalid reads this, aware that the Prophet ﷺ is thinking about him. Soon after he does accept the religion. The father dies of natural causes shortly after hijri. He'd passed away before Badr or any of the early big conflicts. Yet, he passed away quite some time after these verses, and would have been fully aware of them.



# #المدثر٧٤-١٤


وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُۥ تَمْهِيدًۭا ١٤


And spread [everything] before him, easing [his life].
— Saheeh International

and extended (power and honour) to him pretty well.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

making everything easy for him––
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-١٥


ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ ١٥


Then he desires that I should add more.
— Saheeh International

Still, he aspires that I should give him more.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

yet he still hopes I will give him more.
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-١٦


كَلَّآ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ لِـَٔايَـٰتِنَا عَنِيدًۭا ١٦


No! Indeed, he has been toward Our verses obstinate.
— Saheeh International

Never! He is inimical towards Our verses.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

No! He has been stubbornly hostile to Our revelation:
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-١٧


سَأُرْهِقُهُۥ صَعُودًا ١٧

I will cover him with arduous torment.
— Saheeh International

I will force him to climb the mountain Sa‘ūd.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

I will inflict a spiralling torment on him.
— Abdul Haleem

Some say this is a particular cliff in Jahannam.


# #المدثر٧٤-١٨


إِنَّهُۥ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ ١٨


Indeed, he thought and deliberated.
— Saheeh International

He pondered and surmised.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

He planned and plotted––
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-١٩


فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ ١٩


So may he be destroyed [for] how he deliberated.
— Saheeh International

Death onto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

devilishly he plotted!
— Abdul Haleem

It's said that al-Waleed ibn al-Mugheerah was either with the Prophet ﷺ, Abu Bakr r.a., or both at a point, and he heard what they said. And he returned to say that it's the Kalaam Allah, undoubtedly accepting that it's not the words of man. The Quraysh were very concerned about this. Abu Jahl then makes a story up about his people gathering up money for him. Apparently they heard he went to the Prophet ﷺ for his support, and his pride gets to him, saying that he doesn't need the Prophet ﷺ. So instead he says that this is sihr / magic. Most of the ones who died as kaffir knew that there was something special about the Quran. The dunya was just more important to him.


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٠


ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ ٢٠


Then may he be destroyed [for] how he deliberated.
— Saheeh International

Again, death unto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward!
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

ferociously he plotted!––
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-٢١


ثُمَّ نَظَرَ ٢١


Then he considered [again];
— Saheeh International

Then he looked (to those around him,)
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

and looked
— Abdul Haleem

This is his plotting to figure out how to respond


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٢


ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ ٢٢


Then he frowned and scowled;
— Saheeh International

then he frowned and scowled,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

and frowned and scowled
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٣


ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ ٢٣


Then he turned back and was arrogant
— Saheeh International

then turned his back, and waxed proud,
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

and turned away and behaved arrogantly
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٤


فَقَالَ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌۭ يُؤْثَرُ ٢٤


And said, "This is not but magic imitated [from others].
— Saheeh International

then said, “This is nothing but traditional magic;
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

and said, ‘This is just old sorcery,
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٥


إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَّا قَوْلُ ٱلْبَشَرِ ٢٥

This is not but the word of a human being."
— Saheeh International

this is nothing but saying of a mortal.”
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

just the talk of a mortal!’
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٦


سَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ ٢٦



I will drive him into Saqar.
— Saheeh International

I will put him into Saqar (Hell).
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

I will throw him into the scorching Fire.
— Abdul Haleem

The first person comes back here. When Khalid listens to these verses and recites them, he struggles to hear them, particularly with the strength of the punishment described in the following verses.


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٧


وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا سَقَرُ ٢٧


And what can make you know what is Saqar?
— Saheeh International

And what can let you know what Saqar is?
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

What will explain to you what the scorching Fire is?
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٨


لَا تُبْقِى وَلَا تَذَرُ ٢٨


It lets nothing remain and leaves nothing [unburned],
— Saheeh International

It neither spares (anything inside it from burning) nor leaves (any disbeliever outside).
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

It spares nothing and leaves nothing;
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-٢٩


لَوَّاحَةٌۭ لِّلْبَشَرِ ٢٩

Altering [i.e., blackening] the skins.
— Saheeh International

It will disfigure the skins.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

it scorches the flesh of humans;
— Abdul Haleem


# #المدثر٧٤-٣٠


عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ ٣٠

Over it are nineteen [angels].
— Saheeh International

Appointed on it are nineteen (wardens).
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

there are nineteen in charge of it––
— Abdul Haleem

There are 19 main gatekeepers of the hellfire but there will be others beyond them. The Jews or the Quraysh asked the Prophet ﷺ about who these gatekeepers were. Abu Jahl (or al-Waleed) asked about this, mocking that 19 wasn't very many at all. They'd mock by saying that one would take one gatekeeper each. It's an open challenge to the small number.


# #المدثر٧٤-٣١


وَمَا جَعَلْنَآ أَصْحَـٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ إِلَّا مَلَـٰٓئِكَةًۭ ۙ وَمَا جَعَلْنَا عِدَّتَهُمْ إِلَّا فِتْنَةًۭ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِيَسْتَيْقِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَيَزْدَادَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِيمَـٰنًۭا ۙ وَلَا يَرْتَابَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۙ وَلِيَقُولَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌۭ وَٱلْكَـٰفِرُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَـٰذَا مَثَلًۭا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ جُنُودَ رَبِّكَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ وَمَا هِىَ إِلَّا ذِكْرَىٰ لِلْبَشَرِ ٣١


And We have not made the keepers of the Fire except angels. And We have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve - that those who were given the Scripture will be convinced and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the Scripture and the believers will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] and the disbelievers will say, "What does Allāh intend by this as an example?" Thus does Allāh send astray whom He wills and guide whom He wills. And none knows the soldiers of your Lord except Him. And it [i.e., mention of the Fire] is not but a reminder to humanity.
— Saheeh International

And We did not make wardens of the Fire but (from) angels, and did not fix their number but as a test for those who disbelieve, so that those who are given the Book may come to believe, and those who believe may improve in belief, and so that those who are given the Book and those who believe may not doubt (its correctness), and so that those having malady in their hearts and the disbelievers say, “What has Allah meant by this strange statement?” Thus Allah lets go astray whomever He wills, and leads to the right path whomever He wills. And no one knows the hosts of your Lord but He. And this is nothing else but a reminder for mankind.
— Mufti Taqi Usmani

none other than angels appointed by Us to guard Hellfire- and We have made their number a test for the disbelievers. So those who have been given the Scripture will be certain and those who believe will have their faith increased: neither those who have been given the Scripture nor the believers will have any doubts, but the sick at heart and the disbelievers will say, ‘What could God mean by this description?’ God leaves whoever He will to stray and guides whoever He will- no one knows your Lord’s forces except Him- this [description] is a warning to mortals.
— Abdul Haleem

Allah says that only angels were appointed for this role. Surah Tahreem talks about there being angels guarding over the hellfire who are strong and severe who don't disobey and do as they're told. The number of angels is a fitnah. It's just a test where the 19 is mentioned to see the reaction of the people. The Utul Kitaab (Jews) are mentioned here because they were approached a lot by the Quraysh to challenge the Prophet ﷺ. A lot of their questions and challenges were levied to see if the Prophet ﷺ knew the stories of the scriptures. And here's one instance of that but not with the stories of the prophets but with the gatekeepers. And the numbers echo the scriptures. The numbers don't offer much challenge to the believers though. Usually being sick at heart refers to the hypocrites. For the believers, the focus is on the action, the output and the practicalities, whereas the disbelievers question why 19 even though there's not much to come towards from questioning this. But the regardless, the extent of the angels is greater than the other species put together.
